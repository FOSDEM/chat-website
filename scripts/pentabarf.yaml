      <p>File descriptor monitoring is at the core of event-driven applications from graphical applications to web servers. Over the history of Linux, a number of system calls APIs have been introduced to improve upon the performance, features, and interface design. Developers may ask themselves which API they should use and how they differ.</p>

      <p>This talk covers select(2), poll(2), epoll(7), as well as the more recent Linux AIO and io_uring APIs. We will look at the classic scalability challenges with these APIs as well as the latest shared kernel memory ring and polling approaches. An understanding of the evolution of file descriptor monitoring in Linux exposes API design topics that have relevance even if you don't need to implement an event loop in your application.</p>

      <p>The Interpeer Project attempts to provide the technical underpinnings for a
      human centric next generation internet.</p>

      <p>As sensors and compute nodes are now (close to) ubiquitous, it follows that
      there is no longer a static or traceable relationship between ownership of a
      physical processing unit and the personal identifiable data it processes.</p>

      <p>A future internet architecture must take this into account, whilst respecting
      and protecting user's privacy and data protection concerns, also from a
      regulatory point of view. At the same time,
      sharing data in this proliferation of processing units also favours distributed
      approaches over the web's decentralised architecture.</p>

      <p>This session outlines the future the Interpeer Project envisions, and reports
      on achieved outcomes to date.</p>

      <p>The Web has was designed with sharing of textual information in mind, and has
      by now outgrown this purpose. In the academic context in which it was
      conceived, and considering the technical constraints of the time, it made sense
      to design a centralised protocol for up- and downloading documents to a server
      managed by an institution or company. The Web has long evolved away from this,
      and added authentication, authorization and encryption as natural afterthoughts
      to the original design.</p>

      <p>Nowadays, we share more than documents. Our concept of sharing has
      evolved (for better and worse) from only adding to the public domain to
      selectively trusting groups or individuals with specific pieces of
      information.</p>

      <p>While services built on web protocols can and have modelled this

    raw_abstract: |-
      <p>The Interpeer Project attempts to provide the technical underpinnings for a
      human centric next generation internet.</p>

      <p>As sensors and compute nodes are now (close to) ubiquitous, it follows that
      there is no longer a static or traceable relationship between ownership of a
      physical processing unit and the personal identifiable data it processes.</p>

      <p>A future internet architecture must take this into account, whilst respecting
      and protecting user's privacy and data protection concerns, also from a
      regulatory point of view. At the same time,
      sharing data in this proliferation of processing units also favours distributed
      approaches over the web's decentralised architecture.</p>

      <p>This session outlines the future the Interpeer Project envisions, and reports
      on achieved outcomes to date.</p>
    raw_description: |-
      <p>The Web has was designed with sharing of textual information in mind, and has
      by now outgrown this purpose. In the academic context in which it was
      conceived, and considering the technical constraints of the time, it made sense
      to design a centralised protocol for up- and downloading documents to a server
      managed by an institution or company. The Web has long evolved away from this,
      and added authentication, authorization and encryption as natural afterthoughts
      to the original design.</p>

      <p>Nowadays, we share more than documents. Our concept of sharing has
      evolved (for better and worse) from only adding to the public domain to
      selectively trusting groups or individuals with specific pieces of
      information.</p>

      <p>While services built on web protocols can and have modelled this
      new concept, it remains difficult to do well. This and financial incentives
      combined push developers to instead adopt half measures, whereby a central
      instance - the webserver and its legal owners - act as intermediaries to the
      process, weakening the sharing model to commercial, state or criminal
      exploitation.</p>

      <p>There are excellent organisations fighting to amend legislations to
      close such loopholes. The Interpeer Project recognizes that aside from the legal
      struggles, the practical consideration remains that it is much simpler for
      developers to build centralised, vulnerable products than those safe by design.</p>

      <p>It aims at making safe data sharing applications as easy or easier to build by
      starting from the ground up, and embedding the security and synchronization
      concepts for a highly distributed network directly into a new and open
      protocol stack.</p>

      <p>OpenStack today is a complicated beast -- not only does it try to perform well for large clusters, but it also embraces a diverse set of possible implementations from hypervisors, storage, networking, and more. This was a deliberate tactical choice made by the OpenStack community years ago, forming a so called "Big Tent" for vendors to collaborate in to build Open Source cloud options. It made a lot of sense at the time to be honest. However, OpenStack today finds itself constrained by the large number of permutations it must support, ten years of software and backwards compatability legacy, and a decreasing investment from those same vendors that OpenStack courted so actively.</p>

      <p>OpenStack Compute wasn't always like this though. The first public git commit had about 5,000 lines of code in it, and was surprisingly functional. What would a simpler and more opinionated IaaS compute component look like? Especially if it could take advantage of the general improvement of Open Source tooling in the last decade that OpenStack has driven? This was what I was pondering in late 2019 as I started to drift away from the OpenStack community for various reasons. Then, a series of natural disasters in Australia and globally presented me with an opportunity to cancel all my extracurricular activities and really give an experiment a go. That experiment is called Shaken Fist (as in old man shakes fist at cloud), is about the same size as the original OpenStack Compute commit, and is available at https://shakenfist.com. I'd appreciate the opportunity to discuss some of the simplifying assumptions made, what functionality is available, whether the experiment tells us anything interesting, and possible future directions.</p>

    subtitle: a hybrid 3D CPU / VPU / GPU based on OpenPOWER

    abstract: <p>The LibreSOC Project is a hybrid 3D CPU, GPU and VPU, designed for
      use in mass-volume products such as smartphones netbooks tablets and Industrial
      SBC IoT.  As such, user trust and reduced product development costs are both
      equally important.  Both these goal are achieved by providing full source right
      to the bedrock (Hardware HDL, bootloader, drivers, everything) and deploying
      strict transparent "Libre" development criteria. The project has EUR 350,000
      funding from NLnet under their PET Programme and is actively seeking developers.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Analysis of SoCs (system-on-a-chip) used for embedded, mobile and IoT shows a decade-long disturbing persistent trend that is almost 100% without exception across hundreds of integrated processors: not a single recent SoC with modern performance in the past 10 years can be used 100% effectively without at least one closed source driver.  The choices for developers and end-users alike is very stark: go without the GPU, or without the VPU, or without some key critical functionality that would penalise performance or business effectiveness entirely, or compromise on integrity and end-user trust, and reduce product reliability by delivering closed source binary-only drivers.</p>

      <p>Even the highly-regarded Freescale/NXP iMX.6 which uses Etnaviv for the GPU, and has a 19-year Long-Term Supply committment, is still burdened by closed source 3rd party binary-only drivers for the VPU.  Huge multi-man-year efforts consuming precious FOSS engineer resources that could be productively deployed elsewhere are wasted on reverse-engineering these closed SoCs.</p>

      <p>The kicker: unlike a Desktop system where swapping out the Graphics Card is a 15 minute job, you cannot replace the VPU or GPU or crypto-block on an integrated System-on-a-Chip, and you certainly cannot disable the boot-level DRM that prevents booting anything other than pre-approved signed versions of u-boot (Otherwise fantastic Windows 10 ARM laptop products using the Tegra processor quickly became landfill due to the BIOS-level DRM locking that chained right through to applications. applications that could only be downloaded once a Microsoft online account had been registered)</p>

    raw_abstract: <p>The LibreSOC Project is a hybrid 3D CPU, GPU and VPU, designed
      for use in mass-volume products such as smartphones netbooks tablets and Industrial
      SBC IoT.  As such, user trust and reduced product development costs are both
      equally important.  Both these goal are achieved by providing full source right
      to the bedrock (Hardware HDL, bootloader, drivers, everything) and deploying
      strict transparent "Libre" development criteria. The project has EUR 350,000
      funding from NLnet under their PET Programme and is actively seeking developers.</p>
    raw_description: |-
      <p>Analysis of SoCs (system-on-a-chip) used for embedded, mobile and IoT shows a decade-long disturbing persistent trend that is almost 100% without exception across hundreds of integrated processors: not a single recent SoC with modern performance in the past 10 years can be used 100% effectively without at least one closed source driver.  The choices for developers and end-users alike is very stark: go without the GPU, or without the VPU, or without some key critical functionality that would penalise performance or business effectiveness entirely, or compromise on integrity and end-user trust, and reduce product reliability by delivering closed source binary-only drivers.</p>

      <p>Even the highly-regarded Freescale/NXP iMX.6 which uses Etnaviv for the GPU, and has a 19-year Long-Term Supply committment, is still burdened by closed source 3rd party binary-only drivers for the VPU.  Huge multi-man-year efforts consuming precious FOSS engineer resources that could be productively deployed elsewhere are wasted on reverse-engineering these closed SoCs.</p>

      <p>The kicker: unlike a Desktop system where swapping out the Graphics Card is a 15 minute job, you cannot replace the VPU or GPU or crypto-block on an integrated System-on-a-Chip, and you certainly cannot disable the boot-level DRM that prevents booting anything other than pre-approved signed versions of u-boot (Otherwise fantastic Windows 10 ARM laptop products using the Tegra processor quickly became landfill due to the BIOS-level DRM locking that chained right through to applications. applications that could only be downloaded once a Microsoft online account had been registered)</p>

      <p>This situation is one that is not deliberate: it's a product of how SoCs are put together.  It is simply easier for Fabless Semi Companies to license off-the-shelf solutions (GPU hard macro, VPU hard macro) with their associated closed source secretive drivers than it is to tackle what is effectively, to their perspective, a hindrance to sales and profits: issues faced by end-users who know nothing about source code or the close relationship that source code has to "Right to Repair" and security vulnerabilities.</p>

      <p>Unbelievably, then, after more than 10 years of waiting for even just one SoC manufacturer to come out with an SoC that has full source code for its GPU, VPU, bootloader and all other integrated HDL, the solution is to design and bring to market an SoC that does exactly that, developing integrated 3D GPU and VPU capability into the same and providing a 100% committment to provide full source, right to the bedrock: HDL, bootloader, drivers, OS: everything.</p>

      <p>Emotion Engine. Graphics Synthesizer. Built-in DVD player. DualShock. Broadband. Online. $299.
      Twelve years in production, nearly 4,000 titles, and over 150 million units sold worldwide.
      The PlayStation 2 is widely heralded as the most popular video game system of all time.</p>

      <p>Its unassuming, yet imposing black chassis hides a masterclass in system design. Sony's second-most popular product next to the Walkman, and unquestionably their most successful game console, the PS2 isn't without its faults - chief among them, its complexity.
      While a vast effort was made on the part of Sony's engineers, ironing out as many quirks as possible to ensure game development was smooth, even seemingly unsophisticated games had required specialized development steps to ensure satisfactory performance, unless they wanted their game to be mocked in the cutthroat sixth-generation-gamer media for having "last-gen" graphics.
      Why was it so difficult? After all, the CPU is a simple RISC, with a simplified FPU. The GPU, the fabled "Graphics Synthesizer", only draws scenes - no shaders.</p>

      <p>PCSX2, the PS2's de facto open-source emulation project, now has the greatest share of tested playable games and working software titles for its console, out of any emulator targeting consoles since then.
      Unfortunately for us, this compatibility came at the cost of complexity. The long-driven community effort to incrementally improve on it, brought with it legacy code with long, spindly strands which dig deep into the core codebase.
      Its C-centric codebase, while speedy, was hand-tuned to gain the maximum performance out of contemporary 32-bit Pentium 4 CPUs. The GUI, designed using wxWidgets, aimed for a mythological "middle-ground" of such modern platforms as X11R6, Windows XP, and Mac OS X Aqua.</p>

      <p>The project really was a product of its time; emulator development was highly
      fragmented among incompatible and proprietary video and sound APIs, and to compromise, a plugin interface haphazardly bolted on components, leading to needless headaches over trivial things like joystick input.
      These remnants of the past have kept coming to haunt us, and we've decided to put our foot down.</p>

      <p>Twenty years after the inaugural CVS push, it has come high time to reorganize and transform the shambling heap of code, and with the modernization of such a large project comes many discoveries - not only about the emulator software, but also its target machine.</p>

      <p>Points we'll touch on include:
      The PS2, and its architecture - and the cursed idiosyncrasies that developers and emulator authors have had to battle.
      Reverse engineering the PS2, and studying its behavior - following a game through, from the DVD, into the I/O subsystem, across the bus, through the cache and memory, across the vector units, and out to the TV.
      How PCSX2 works - how it is programmed and evolved to take advantage of modern hardware (and why that's a constantly moving target).
      Finally, we'll conclude with a deep dive into the new x86_64 JIT compilers coming to PCSX2, its clean core/GUI separation being made with portability in mind, notes about refactoring and scope management of a software system at-large with an active user base; new GUI targets, some infrastructure rework, and more!</p>

      <p>Supported since Linux 5.10, the AMD SEV Encrypted State (SEV-ES) feature can be used to protect the confidentiality of a virtual machine (VM) by means of encryption and attestation.
      Although the memory and registers of the VM are encrypted, the VM still communicates with the hypervisor for the emulation of special instructions and devices.
      Because these operations have not been previously considered part of the attack surface, we discovered that a malicious hypervisor can provide semantically incorrect information in order to bypass SEV-ES.
      In this talk, I provide technical details on the handling of special operations with SEV-ES, practically show how the original implementation could be exploited, and finally I show how the interfaces were hardened to fix the issues.</p>

      1) use virtual devices to extract encryption keys and secret data from a virtual machine.
      2) reduce the entropy of probabilistic kernel defenses in the VM by carefully manipulating the results of the CPUID and RDTSC instructions.
      3) extract secret data or inject code by forging fake MMIO regions over the VM’s address space.
      4) trick the VM to decrypt its stack and use Return Oriented Programming to execute arbitrary code inside the VM.</p>

      <p>Running Linux containers (e.g., Docker) on macOS is currently implemented with using Hypervisor.framework (or similar VMM) by hosting a (thin) Linux guest, and users operate it from the host macOS via same command-line interface.  We go beyond this complete framework by exploiting library-OS/unikernel idea in a container runtime.  We ported containerd to macOS first (*1), which is currently under review, and run Linux applications with Linux Kernel Library (LKL), a library version of Linux kernel, which have no compatibility concerns as LKL is derived from Linux kernel.  As a bonus, we benefit from the extensibility of the kernel components of Linux containers (as Kata containers does), while keeping low resource footprint of containers (as Nabla or other unikernels implementations can).</p>

      <p>Because the containerd port is still undergoing, we aim this talk at giving a broader view the pull request, with why we've been worked on for this direction, how it internally works, what benefit we can obtain, and where we are moving forward.  We will also give a simple demonstration of running Linux containers on macOS (on Intel but hopefully on arm64 if it's getting ready).</p>

      <p>We'll dive into a hands on example, where we will train an image classification machine learning model from scratch, deploy it as a microservice in Kubernetes, and introduce advanced monitoring components as architectural patterns with hands on examples. These monitoring techniques will include AI Explainers, Outlier Detectors, Concept Drift detectors and Adversarial Detectors. We will also be understanding high level architectural patterns that abstract these complex and advanced monitoring techniques into infrastructural components that will enable for scale, introducing the standardised interfaces required for us to enable monitoring across hundreds or thousands of heterogeneous machine learning models.</p>

      <p>Many advanced data processing paradigms fit incredibly well to the parallel-architecture that GPU computing offers, which has resulted in the continuously growing adoption of graphics card for general purpose computing. Exciting advancements in the open source Vulkan Project are enabling developers to take advantage of general purpose GPU computing capabilities in cross-vendor mobile and desktop GPUs including AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA &amp; friends.</p>

      <p>In this talk we will learn to write GPU accelerated algorithms which will be able to run on virtually any GPU hardware, including non-NVIDIA GPUs. We'll introduce an intuition and key concepts around GPU computing, as well as show how you can get started with the Vulkan Kompute framework with only a handful of lines of C++ or Python code.</p>

      <p>Throughout the talk we will also dive into the GPU computing terminology around asynchronous &amp; parallel workflow processing, cover the core principles of machine learning data parallelism, explain the hardware concepts of GPU queues &amp; queueFamilies, and talk about how advancements in new and upcoming graphics cards will enable for even bigger speedups (such as the NVIDIA Ampere GA10x architecture which will support up to 3 parallel queue processing workloads).</p>

      <p>In more detail these are the topics of the talk:</p>

      <p>• GPU computing intuition, hardware and foundations</p>

      <p>• Deeper dive into the OSS Vulkan C++ SDK enabling cross-vendor GPU computing</p>

      <p>• The C++ Kompute Framework and its architecture which augments Vulkan</p>

      <p>• Simple C++ Example with Kompute</p>

      <p>• Deeper Optimizations (Batch Commands, Asynchronous and Parallel Workloads)</p>

      <p>• FamilyQueues for Hardware-Parallel Workloads</p>

      <p>• C++ Example for FamilyQueue Hardware-Parallel Workload</p>

      <p>I observed a white paper authoring collaboration workflow problem at my Forbes 50 employer wherein a tedious workflow around legacy tooling caused undue stress, headaches, rework, and, ultimately, a cosmetically poor-looking document with inconsistent content and styles. Knowing that a good document requires both good content and presentation, I proposed and led the creation of a simple workflow amenable to our team's software engineers and data scientists: treating the white paper text as code with technologies including Markdown, GitHub Enterprise, Pandoc, LaTeX, and a review process that gets the tooling out of the way in order to enable content authors to focus less on logistics and more on writing and reviewing. The result was that a team of seven engineers and data scientists created a 50-page document containing text, diagrams, equations, graphics, and more in just two weeks. The result greatly pleased our directors and executives. They praised our team not only for the incredibly valuable content but also for the professional appearance of the document. When they learned about the peer review process we used to create it, they wanted more teams to use it.</p>

      <p>This talk focuses on the problems of passing around files by email or shared drives, the problems of collaborative editing of online documentation, and the problems we're still addressing in our solution that we've now used to author several significant internal documents.</p>

      <p>Visual Studio Code is an extremely popular editor and has a very rich ecosystem of extensions. However, testing these extensions is rather tricky in practice. Often extensions require external resources which have to be injected into the development environment. Unit tests are quite bad at testing the UI itself, as they require extensive setup code and a lot of mocking (= implementation of the production API in the testing environment that exposes the same interface). Checking the results of them still requires one to manually verify that the UI looks correct. All this combined can easily lead to false-positives and false-negatives. Integration tests on the other hand are not a silver bullet either as they can be rather brittle, slow, lengthy to write, hard to set up while also not being able to cover edge-cases very efficiently.
      This talk will focus on what we learned while developing the Open Build Service Connector: which testing strategies work, which don't and what tools to use. We will cover some viable approaches to unit testing and the vscode-extension-tester module that we used for integration tests.</p>

      <p>Visual Studio Code is an extremely popular editor and has a very rich ecosystem of extensions. However, testing these extensions is rather tricky in practice. Often extensions require external resources which have to be injected into the development environment. Unit tests are quite bad at testing the UI itself, as they require extensive setup code and a lot of mocking (= implementation of the production API in the testing environment that exposes the same interface). Checking the results of them still requires one to manually verify that the UI looks correct. All this combined can easily lead to false-positives and false-negatives. Integration tests on the other hand are not a silver bullet either as they can be rather brittle, slow, lengthy to write, hard to set up while also not being able to cover edge-cases very efficiently.
      This talk will focus on what we learned while developing the Open Build Service Connector: which testing strategies work, which don't and what tools to use. We will cover some viable approaches to unit testing and the vscode-extension-tester module that we used for integration tests.</p>

      <p>Grafana Tempo is a new high volume distributed tracing backend whose only dependency is object storage.  Unlike other tracing backends Tempo can hit massive scale without a massive and difficult to manage Elasticsearch or Cassandra cluster.  The current trade off for using object storage is that Tempo supports search by trace id only.  However, we will see how this trade off can be overcome using the other pillars of observability.</p>

      <p>In this session we will use an OpenTelemetry instrumented application to demonstrate how to use logs and Prometheus exemplars to find traces effectively in Tempo. Internal Grafana metrics will also be shared as we all discuss how to scale tracing as far as possible with less operational cost and complexity than ever before.</p>

      <p>The LibreSOC hybrid 3D CPU-VPU-GPU is intended to provide a significant reduction in both hardware complexity, software (driver) complexity and systems integration primarily initially for embedded and mobile environments.</p>

      <p>Larrabee or more specifically Nyuzi showed that a software-only "Traditional Vector Processor" architecture makes for a fantastic High Performance Compute Engine that, unfortunately, also turns out to have only 25% the performance/watt of current competitive embedded mobile GPUs. Not only that but SIMD, despite being (seductively) easy to implement by hardware engineers, has been shown to have harmful consequences at the software level (setup and loop end cleanup).  A recent patch to glibc6 to add POWER9 VSX strncpy was a whopping 250 hand-crafted assembly instructions, where its equivalent using Cray Vector principles is around 14.</p>

      <p>All of this was solved decades ago by Cray Vector designs, and then forgotten. Only now is variable-length Vectorisation being rediscovered and deployed in modern architectures: RISC-V RVV, ARM SVE2 and also Simple-V.  This talk therefore goes through the background and concepts behind Simple-V.  Thanks to a grant from NLnet, SV will be formally documented and proposed formally as an extension to OpenPOWER, for review by the OpenPOWER Foundation.</p>

      <p>The curriculum in the general and undergraduate curriculum, in particular, is one of the most important pillars of an education system. The undergraduate curriculum has two main objectives i.e. employability and higher education. The greatest challenge in designing an undergraduate curriculum is achieving a balance between employability skills and laying the foundation for higher education. Generally, the curriculum is a combination of core technical subjects, professional electives, humanities, and skill-oriented subjects. We used natural language processing and machine learning packages in Python to build a curriculum design system.</p>

      <p>The steps to build a curriculum design system are described below:
      1. The dataset was built from the job profiles from different job listing websites like stackoverflow.com, indeed.com, linkedin.com, and monster.com. Also from the syllabus of competitive exams and qualifying exams for higher education.
      2. On the dataset, we applied natural language processing techniques to identify the subjects and subject content. For natural language processing, we used spaCy an industrial-strength Natural Language Processing package in Python.
      3. To generate syllabus content for a particular subject, a pointer-generator network was used. The pointer generator network is a text summarization technique that combines extractive and abstractive summarization techniques. The extractive summarization technique extracts keywords from the dataset, whereas the abstractive summarization technique generates new text from the existing text. The pointer-generator network was implemented using the scikit-learn machine learning package in Python.
      4. The generated curriculum was then compared with the existing curriculum to get insights like, how much percent of the curriculum is industry oriented, how much percent of the curriculum is aimed at higher education and job-oriented skills. At this step, we used the ROGUE (Recall-Oriented Understudy Gisting Evaluation) metric to compare the generated curriculum against the reference/proposed curriculum
      5. The above steps can be repeated with modified parameters to get better insights and curriculum.</p>

      <p>This also gives us an idea of how we can have an evolving curriculum that can help us bridge the gap between industry and academia.</p>

      <p>With Kubernetes gaining popularity for performance-critical workloads such as 5G, Edge, IoT, Telco, and AI/ML, it is becoming increasingly important to meet stringent networking and resource management requirements of these use cases. Performance-critical workloads like these require topology information in order to use co-located CPU cores and devices. Despite the success of Topology Manager, aligning topology of requested resources, the current native scheduler does not select a node based on it. It's time to solve this problem!
      We will introduce the audience to hardware topology, the current state of Topology Manager, gaps in the current scheduling process, and prior out-of-tree solutions. We'll explain the workarounds available right now: custom schedulers, creating scheduling extensions, using node selectors, or manually assigning resources semi-automatically. All these methods have their drawbacks.
      Finally, we will explain how we plan to improve the native scheduler to work with Topology Manager. Attendees will learn both current workarounds, and the future of topology aware scheduling in Kubernetes.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Kubernetes has taken the world by storm attracting unconventional workloads such as HPC Edge, IoT, Telco and Comm service providers, 5G, AI/ML and NFV solutions to it. This talk would benefit users, engineers, and cluster admins deploying performance sensitive workloads on k8s. Addition of newer nodes running alongside older ones in data centers results in hardware heterogeneity. Motivated by saving physical space in the data centers, newer nodes are packed with more CPUs, enhanced hardware capabilities. Exposing to use fine grain topology information for optimised workload placement would help service providers and VNF vendors too.
      We’ll explain numerous challenges encountered in efficiently deploying workloads due to inability to understand the hardware topology of the underlying bare metal infrastructure and scheduling based on it.
      Scheduler’s lack of knowledge of resource topology can lead to unpredictable application performance, in general under-performance, and in the worst case, complete mismatch of resource requests and kubelet policies, scheduling a pod where it is destined to fail, potentially entering a failure loop. Exposing cluster level topology to the scheduler empowers it to make intelligent NUMA aware placement decisions optimizing cluster wide performance of workloads. This would benefit Telco User Group in kubernetes, kubernetes and the overall CNCF ecosystem enabling improved application performance without impacting user experience.</p>

      We’ll explain numerous challenges encountered in efficiently deploying workloads due to inability to understand the hardware topology of the underlying bare metal infrastructure and scheduling based on it.
      Scheduler’s lack of knowledge of resource topology can lead to unpredictable application performance, in general under-performance, and in the worst case, complete mismatch of resource requests and kubelet policies, scheduling a pod where it is destined to fail, potentially entering a failure loop. Exposing cluster level topology to the scheduler empowers it to make intelligent NUMA aware placement decisions optimizing cluster wide performance of workloads. This would benefit Telco User Group in kubernetes, kubernetes and the overall CNCF ecosystem enabling improved application performance without impacting user experience.</p>

      <p>Penpot (formerly UXBOX) is an Open Source online design &amp; prototyping platform with the aim of bringing the whole team to the design process. Penpot is multiplatform (web based) and based on open standards (SVG). The platform provides a set of tools meant not only for designers but also for developers and stakeholders. Design, prototype, feedback system, handoff specifications and low-code among them.</p>

      <p>We will share our vision, Penpot’s current state and our next challenges about the project. We will also perform a demo and hope to contribute to the already open channel between FOSS and Design.</p>

      <p>We often see many open source projects struggle with maintaining quality documentation and finding contributors who are interested in helping with project documentation. There are several reasons for this, such as many viewing documentation as a separate product from code or a belief that people will be able to make sense of what the code is doing by reading the code.</p>

      <p>For these and other reasons, documentation work is often done at the last minute and done by people with low motivation and minimum effort. So the quality of the output will naturally suffer. These issues can be addressed by ensuring that documentation is everyone’s responsibility and that documentation is a core part of the product created using the same development and community processes. Besides, documentation is often an entry point for new community members and is a great place for early contributions. When everyone in the community is actively engaged in documentation--e.g., reviewing documentation fixes--it can help provide a valuable onboarding experience for new community members.</p>

      <p>In this session, the speakers will share their experience in documentation from both foundation-based open source projects and open source software companies. There will be a discussion on how community contributions for documentation can be encouraged and how community members can apply their learnings from documentation to other areas of open source communities. </p>

      <p>Open source is becoming the main ingredient for companies to success. To achieve it, companies need to manage efficiently their relationship with open source projects. And that’s the main goal for companies’ Open Source Program Office (OSPO). So, they are key for companies success. But, additionally, they could be very important for open source projects sustainability.</p>

      <p>During this talk, you will learn about the responsibilities and benefits of having an OSPO in your organization, why should companies adapt to open source and adopt an OSPO, how it makes a difference to have a team responsible for viewing, managing, making critical decisions, contributions back to open source projects, and providing oversight for open source initiatives on their company and where they should start. Also, we will give real examples of how companies are doing this today and their impact for the community.</p>

      <p>Raku is a multi-paradigm language, that is able to do meta-programming, declarative, object-oriented programing as well as many other specific features. At 5 years, it's still a young language, but some patterns are emerging that make it quite suitable for practicing your programming chops, or embark in some side project. In this talk we will introduce some interesting programming patterns that are seen, possibly, nowhere else, from "grammaroles" through "piggybacking objects".
      On the other hand, for a language where TIMTOWDI, there is more than one way to do it, talking about antipatterns might look paradoxical. So let's see how we get out of this catch-22 situation.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Raku was created as a language for the next 100 years by its creator, Larry Wall, and as such it incorporates most of the paradigms tha modern language use, from a very extensive Unicode foundation, to a more classic, but still new at heart, approach to functional programming. It's this mix and match of programming paradigms that make it unique, and it's also what has provoked the emergence of certain programming patterns that solve unique problems in an interesting way. This arises as much from its design, as from its implementation, which uses Raku itself for most of it.
      Anyway, this talk will be about a short introduction to some Raku features, followed by a few programming patterns exemplified in Raku and in the closest you can get in other, modern languages. The main objective of the talk is to pique the curiosity about this language, which is still new, and its interesting, diverse and enthusiastic community.</p>

In the process, we fixed a lot of problems directly in upstream, which benefits all users.

    abstract: "<p>There are many things in which software can help grade computer
      science assignments, since these will consist mainly in executable pieces of
      code. However, in the same way DevOps will involve teams that code, test and
      set up infraestructure, ClassOps will have to add teachers to that equation.
      At any rate, it will imply that teachers will need to lay down in code the requirements
      of a student assignment (which can be as simple as testing for inclusion of
      a file or as complex of setting up the infrastructure to probe the code in different
      ways) and set up CI pipelines to actually test, and give meaningful (and fast!)
      feedback to the student so that it's included in their learning experience.
      This (lightning) talk will explain how the speaker set up that kind in infrastructure
      in Travis and, lately, GitHub actions, and how that resulted as a learning experience
      for him and his students.</p>"
    description: |-
      <p>For professors, grading is grunt work, and mostly done manually. As such, it's usually limited to the things that can be checked by hand. This eventually results in a very limited understanding of the learning process of students, lengthy grading process and bad learning outcomes for students. The first step is understanding grading as part of the learning process for students: it's simply a chance to give feedback to students so that they can fulfill their learning objectives. This needs to be done frequently and meaningfully. The second step is decoupling grading from your personal appreciation and setting it up as a functional requirement. Joining both things leads to automating grading as much as possible.
      While I had been using GitHub for turning in assignments for quite some time, I really started using CI pipelines in 2017, initially with Travis, and adding GitHub actions in 2019 when they started to admit people into the beta. They are used alongside each other now, making assignments undergo different kinds of tests, from (mild) plagiarism to, lately, setting up the student environment in a Docker container and run things inside it. The main idea of this talk will be how to pass from concept to (software) test, how the different tests have been set up, and what kind of obstacles have been found along the way. And, of course, if this has resulted in better learning outcomes for students.</p>

    raw_abstract: "<p>There are many things in which software can help grade computer
      science assignments, since these will consist mainly in executable pieces of
      code. However, in the same way DevOps will involve teams that code, test and
      set up infraestructure, ClassOps will have to add teachers to that equation.
      At any rate, it will imply that teachers will need to lay down in code the requirements
      of a student assignment (which can be as simple as testing for inclusion of
      a file or as complex of setting up the infrastructure to probe the code in different
      ways) and set up CI pipelines to actually test, and give meaningful (and fast!)
      feedback to the student so that it's included in their learning experience.
      This (lightning) talk will explain how the speaker set up that kind in infrastructure
      in Travis and, lately, GitHub actions, and how that resulted as a learning experience
      for him and his students.</p>"
    raw_description: |-
      <p>For professors, grading is grunt work, and mostly done manually. As such, it's usually limited to the things that can be checked by hand. This eventually results in a very limited understanding of the learning process of students, lengthy grading process and bad learning outcomes for students. The first step is understanding grading as part of the learning process for students: it's simply a chance to give feedback to students so that they can fulfill their learning objectives. This needs to be done frequently and meaningfully. The second step is decoupling grading from your personal appreciation and setting it up as a functional requirement. Joining both things leads to automating grading as much as possible.
      While I had been using GitHub for turning in assignments for quite some time, I really started using CI pipelines in 2017, initially with Travis, and adding GitHub actions in 2019 when they started to admit people into the beta. They are used alongside each other now, making assignments undergo different kinds of tests, from (mild) plagiarism to, lately, setting up the student environment in a Docker container and run things inside it. The main idea of this talk will be how to pass from concept to (software) test, how the different tests have been set up, and what kind of obstacles have been found along the way. And, of course, if this has resulted in better learning outcomes for students.</p>

      <p>Containers, kubernetes and virtualizations are, as never before, the shining objects of our times. While we are used to implementing them in case of stateless situations, it becomes more difficult to see them serve properly in case of stateful solutions like RDBMS.
      But after I have won some personal reluctance, I started to experiment with the Percona Operator for MySQL. With this presentation, I will bring you a short journey as a result of my experience as DBA in the usage of the Percona Operator for MySQL.
      We will see from one side failures, misunderstanding and some frustration. From the other side a learning process that brings me to have better comprehension of the possible utilization and the best way to achieve it. Finally my personal considerations.</p>

      <p>Elephant flows appear irregularly, can consume almost half of the available bandwidth and are consequently associated with a host of issues. Securing elephant flows with IPsec is a well-known challenge to SDN and SD-WAN solutions on commodity hardware. The key problems for those developing solutions are:
      -   How to seamlessly enable dedicated HW to accelerate IPsec processing when available?
      -   How to distribute workloads to more CPU cores and maintain packets ordering to scale?
      -   How to scale up/scale down the computer resource usage when the elephant flow appears and disappears?

      <p>This presentation illustrates how the GNU Emacs text editor provides
      an powerful integrated environment for reproducible research,
      effectively bypassing the need for juggling different software in
      order to write and execute code, manage data or write papers. GNU
      Emacs as a long history, and is still widely used and supported by a
      very active community of users and developers. A very popular feature
      of GNU Emacs is Org-mode which, at its core, offers a markup language
      similar to Markdown.</p>

      <p>Following a brief introduction to Org-mode, this presentation
      demonstrates its use for reproducible research: straightforward mixing
      of prose and code, execution of code blocks as well as display of the
      results. With Org-mode, GNU Emacs is turned into a computational
      notebook which functionalities goes well beyond popular alternatives
      such as Jupyter. Code blocks are not restricted to a particular
      programming language and data can be passed between them: generate
      data in C, analyse it in Python, visualise it with R, all in one
      single executable document. Moreover, Org-mode documents are nothing
      but plain text, making them inherently portable, sustainable, and
      suited to version control - crucial qualities for academic research.

    raw_abstract: |-
      <p>This presentation illustrates how the GNU Emacs text editor provides
      an powerful integrated environment for reproducible research,
      effectively bypassing the need for juggling different software in
      order to write and execute code, manage data or write papers. GNU
      Emacs as a long history, and is still widely used and supported by a
      very active community of users and developers. A very popular feature
      of GNU Emacs is Org-mode which, at its core, offers a markup language
      similar to Markdown.</p>

      <p>Following a brief introduction to Org-mode, this presentation
      demonstrates its use for reproducible research: straightforward mixing
      of prose and code, execution of code blocks as well as display of the
      results. With Org-mode, GNU Emacs is turned into a computational
      notebook which functionalities goes well beyond popular alternatives
      such as Jupyter. Code blocks are not restricted to a particular
      programming language and data can be passed between them: generate
      data in C, analyse it in Python, visualise it with R, all in one
      single executable document. Moreover, Org-mode documents are nothing
      but plain text, making them inherently portable, sustainable, and
      suited to version control - crucial qualities for academic research.
      Moving on, I illustrate the export of Org-mode documents to richer
      formats: PDF, ODT, HTML and many more - all from within GNU Emacs.
      Lastly, I broaden the scope of this presentation and discuss the open
      nature of GNU Emacs itself. Indeed, GNU Emacs is free (as in freedom)
      software under a copyleft license. This ensures that GNU Emacs remains

    description: |-
      <p>A voting advice application is a great way to support elections and democracy as a whole by making the parties or candidates more transparent and comparable. The differences between political parties are often difficult to understand for the voters, especially for first-time voters. To make elections more accessible some countries have started to offer election compasses, or VAAs. Services like these help citizens getting to know the parties or candidates by presenting a carefully chosen collection of political statements. The users and the parties both take position to these statements. Based on this, voters can quickly get a comparison between their own opinions and the positions of the parties. In Germany, this service is implemented by the bpb, the Federal Agency for Civic Education and is called "Wahl-O-Mat". In the Netherlands this concept is called "StemWijzer". Software like this has developed in the early 2000s and evolved ever since. Running such a project offers great value to citizens, the political system and our democracy. It is also very expensive. Implementing an election compass is not only time consuming, but also requires great technical knowledge. Usually, there is no election compass for smaller elections, because hiring software developers is simply out of budget.</p>

      <p>OpenElectionCompass offers a free alternative – free as in free speech as well as in free beer. The requirements for a voting advice application are very similar, be it for a small or a national election, for an election in Berlin or an election in Brussels. OpenElectionCompass aims to provide a free solution, simple to configure, customize and deploy. By continuously improving our project, we have an advantage over agencies doing this only every few years. And by not developing behind closed doors, we are transparent and open for everyone.</p>

      <p>The popular but aging shells (Bash and the like) suffer from many design flaws:
      lack of structured data, pipes are hard-to-debug blackboxes, lack of
      interactivity, while the user interfaces are mostly poor and limiting.
      High time we moved on away from this cruft, starting with a top-notch
      interactive language boasting full-fledged introspection and debugging.</p>

Open source has core principles that make it rely on collaboration between contributors and companies in order to achieve a common goal. To attain more collaborations, onboarding in most open source communities should be considered a priority.  Oftentimes, beginners who are new to open source projects develop cold feet a short while after joining a community because they are not properly onboarded into the community.  Onboarding plays a major role in the performance of and productivity of contributors. In this session, I would like to talk on:

      <p>When developing open source software end-user applications or reusable software packages, developers depend on software packages distributed through package managers such as npm, Packagist, Cargo, RubyGems. In addition to this, empirical evidence has shown that these package managers adhere to a large extent to semantic versioning principles. Packages that are still in major version zero are considered unstable according to semantic versioning, as some developers consider such packages as immature, still being under initial development.</p>

      <p>This presentation reports on large-scale empirical evidence on the use of dependencies towards 0.y.z versions in four different software package distributions: Cargo, npm, Packagist and RubyGems. We study to which extent packages get stuck in the zero version space, never crossing the psychological barrier of major version zero. We compare the effect of the policies and practices of package managers on this phenomenon. We do not reveal the results of our findings in this abstract yet, as it would spoil the fun of the presentation.</p>

      <p>This empirical study builds further on our earlier work, in which we have studied different kinds of dependency management issues in software package distributions.</p>

      <p>The current empirical evolutionary study is based on recent package management metadata of 1.5 million packages, totaling 12 million package releases and 56 million package dependencies. We analyse dependency version constraints to determine:
      * to which extent packages depend on 0.y.z releases of other packages;
      * whether packages with major version zero ever cross the psychological barrier of 1.0.0;
      * whether there is any reluctance to depend on 0.y.z packages;

      <p>Google is known for building massive, global scale solutions. While organizations rarely have a similar scale, we can learn from those solutions while developing in Open Source. We all see the successes of Kubernetes which was inspired by Google Borg, and Prometheus based on Google Borgmon.</p>

      <p>The presentation is about the technology stack of the truly distributed free banking technology "DIVA". It's also about the fact that "distributed technology" does not offer anything like a "business model" in the old-fashioned-cloudy way. It's about the overlay network "I2P". It's about the distributed storage engine "Iroha" and the challenges with a very slow network. It's about banking business logic, the user interface and its challenges being fully distributed. And it's about the research co-operations in Switzerland.</p>

      <p>Emerging applications like artificial intelligence and autonomous car require high security-assurance, which stimulates the wide-spread deployment of trusted execution environment (TEE). However, prior enclave systems are far from the ideal for three reasons.
      1) Scalability: only support limited secure memory or limited number of instances;
      2) Performance: not well-fit the requirements of high-performance application, e.g., poor secure communication performance;
      3) Security: many still have security flaws, e.g., suffering cache-based side channels attacks.</p>

      <p>Penglai-Enclave is proposed to overcome these challenges. The Penglai open-source project aims to build a scalable and efficient TEE system based on RISC-V, which is made powerful through hardware-assisted scalable physical memory isolation extensions. Our evaluations show that Penglai can achieve more than 1,000 concurrently running instances even in a resource-restricted device. We also have supported libraries like ARM PSA on Penglai to ease the development of trusted applications, and applied formal methods to validate its software TCB.</p>

      <p>Open source software powers incredible scientific and research discoveries, from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01155-0">images of the black hole in 2019</a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007747">visualising proteins in 3D virtual reality</a>, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000730">open source hardware can affordably save lives during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. Despite this, the academic credit/metric system does not incentivise or reward activities around code sharing, instead preferring to use research papers, and citations for structured reward and promotion systems.</p>

      <p>In this short talk, we will share the vision of the Wellcome Trust <a href="https://wellcome.org/what-we-do/our-work/data-science-and-health-trustworthy-data-science">Data for Science and Health</a> team, which is working over the next five years to incentivise the foundational tools, trust, and talent required to recognise and fund open research software sustainably.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Picture Sam, a researcher in a white coat: they spend hours in the lab with their beakers, test tubes, and agar plates. Once they’ve gathered results they think the world will want to know, they write up their conclusions, publish in a journal, and repeat. While this type of research has existed for a long time, and will continue to do so, this model doesn’t effectively acknowledge newer scenarios, where machines and mass data collection result in what is often referred to by the now-buzzword “big data” – data at a scale where it must be managed and analysed with the use of computers.</p>

      <p>This type of research gap is often addressed by Joy, the computational researcher. Joy may identify as a coder, a researcher, an engineer, a data scientist, support staff, a lab assistant, or some other title. The main theme is that Joy writes computer code in order to make their job easier, or perhaps even to make it feasible at all. Given that this computer code feeds into and creates the end results, it is reasonable to consider it a research method, albeit a less traditional research method or output than the research paper.</p>

      <p>In the current world, Joy is typically less supported than a more traditional academic like Sam: Fewer funding calls exist for funding code work, and ever fewer recognise or reward good open source behaviour, even though an incredible number of scientific analyses rely on open source software themselves, and even though the perils of <em>not</em> sharing research code could be completely wrong scientific results that don't look wrong since no-one can see inside the black-box of proprietary code. Things have gotten a little better - there are scientific journals that accept software papers, and even journals that are exclusive to open source software papers, but they're far from the norm. We still have a long way to go.</p>

      <p>In order to make real progress, research code <em>must</em> be open to allow others to verify, re-use, and build upon it. This includes recognising and funding underfunded areas such as open source community management, accessibility, software maintenance, and user experience. The Wellcome Trust has dedicated £75 million GBP over the next five years towards making trustworthy data science a first-class citizen in the research ecosystem. By sharing our vision with others in the open source world we hope to encourage this attitude, meet others working towards the same goals, and meet prominent contributors to the open source research ecosystem who might be looking for funding opportunities.</p>

      <p>Open source software powers incredible scientific and research discoveries, from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01155-0">images of the black hole in 2019</a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007747">visualising proteins in 3D virtual reality</a>, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000730">open source hardware can affordably save lives during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. Despite this, the academic credit/metric system does not incentivise or reward activities around code sharing, instead preferring to use research papers, and citations for structured reward and promotion systems.</p>

      <p>In this short talk, we will share the vision of the Wellcome Trust <a href="https://wellcome.org/what-we-do/our-work/data-science-and-health-trustworthy-data-science">Data for Science and Health</a> team, which is working over the next five years to incentivise the foundational tools, trust, and talent required to recognise and fund open research software sustainably.</p>

      <p>Picture Sam, a researcher in a white coat: they spend hours in the lab with their beakers, test tubes, and agar plates. Once they’ve gathered results they think the world will want to know, they write up their conclusions, publish in a journal, and repeat. While this type of research has existed for a long time, and will continue to do so, this model doesn’t effectively acknowledge newer scenarios, where machines and mass data collection result in what is often referred to by the now-buzzword “big data” – data at a scale where it must be managed and analysed with the use of computers.</p>

      <p>This type of research gap is often addressed by Joy, the computational researcher. Joy may identify as a coder, a researcher, an engineer, a data scientist, support staff, a lab assistant, or some other title. The main theme is that Joy writes computer code in order to make their job easier, or perhaps even to make it feasible at all. Given that this computer code feeds into and creates the end results, it is reasonable to consider it a research method, albeit a less traditional research method or output than the research paper.</p>

      <p>In the current world, Joy is typically less supported than a more traditional academic like Sam: Fewer funding calls exist for funding code work, and ever fewer recognise or reward good open source behaviour, even though an incredible number of scientific analyses rely on open source software themselves, and even though the perils of <em>not</em> sharing research code could be completely wrong scientific results that don't look wrong since no-one can see inside the black-box of proprietary code. Things have gotten a little better - there are scientific journals that accept software papers, and even journals that are exclusive to open source software papers, but they're far from the norm. We still have a long way to go.</p>

      <p>In order to make real progress, research code <em>must</em> be open to allow others to verify, re-use, and build upon it. This includes recognising and funding underfunded areas such as open source community management, accessibility, software maintenance, and user experience. The Wellcome Trust has dedicated £75 million GBP over the next five years towards making trustworthy data science a first-class citizen in the research ecosystem. By sharing our vision with others in the open source world we hope to encourage this attitude, meet others working towards the same goals, and meet prominent contributors to the open source research ecosystem who might be looking for funding opportunities.</p>

      <p>In high-performance computing (HPC), interactive access to HPC systems and the ability to perform experiments in rapid-prototyping environments are getting more important. Jupyter notebooks have become a popular tool to create and share documents that contain narrative text, visualizations and live code, and the xeus-cling kernel provides support for native C/C++ code via the Cling interpreter. In this talk, we will present how we extended these technologies to support parallel programming with MPI and OpenMP, the de-facto standards in HPC.</p>

      <p>In the context of parallel programming, the resulting environment supports rapid prototyping and e-learning equally well. We will present an overview about its capabilities, demonstrate selected use cases and resources that we developed. In addition, we incorporated support for runtime correctness checking of MPI and OpenMP parallel programs. We will explain how we added support to write out binary programs from Jupyter notebooks and how to run code under the control of existing open source correctness tools.</p>

      <p>FPGA accelerators on the NIC enable the offloading of expensive packet processing tasks from the CPU. However, FPGAs have limited resources that may need to be shared among diverse applications, and programming them is difficult.
      We present a solution to run Linux’s eXpress Data Path programs written in eBPF on FPGAs, using only a fraction of the available hardware resources while matching the performance of high-end CPUs. The iterative execution model of eBPF is not a good fit for FPGA accelerators. Nonetheless, we show that many of the instructions of an eBPF program can be compressed, parallelized or completely removed, when targeting a purpose-built FPGA executor, thereby significantly improving performance. We leverage that to design hXDP, which includes (i) an optimizing-compiler that parallelizes and translates eBPF bytecode to an extended eBPF Instruction-set Architecture defined by us; a (ii) soft-CPU to execute such instructions on FPGA; and (iii) an FPGA-based infrastructure to provide XDP’s maps and helper functions as defined within the Linux kernel.
      We implement hXDP on an FPGA NIC and evaluate it running real-world unmodified eBPF programs. Our implementation is clocked at 156.25MHz, uses about 15% of the FPGA resources, and can run dynamically loaded programs. Despite these modest requirements, it achieves the packet processing throughput of a high-end CPU core and provides a 10x lower packet forwarding latency.</p>

    abstract: |-
      <p>The European Environment for Scientific Software Installations (EESSI, pronounced as “easy”) is a collaboration between different HPC sites and industry partners, with the common goal to set up a shared repository of scientific software installations that can be used on a variety of systems, regardless of which flavor/version of Linux distribution or processor architecture is used, or whether it is a full-size HPC cluster, a cloud environment or a personal workstation.</p>

      <p>The EESSI codebase (https://github.com/eessi) is open source and heavily relies on various other open-source software, including Ansible, archspec, CernVM-FS, Cluster-in-the-Cloud, EasyBuild, Gentoo Prefix, Lmod, ReFrame, Singularity, and Terraform.</p>

      <p>The concept of the EESSI project was inspired by the Compute Canada software stack, and consists of three main layers:
      - a filesystem layer leveraging the established CernVM-FS technology, to globally distribute the EESSI software stack;
      - a compatibility layer using Gentoo Prefix, to ensure compatibility with different client operating systems (different Linux distributions, macOS, Windows Subsystem for Linux);
      - a software layer, hosting optimized installations of scientific software along with required dependencies, which were built for different processor architectures, and where archspec, EasyBuild and Lmod are leveraged.</p>

      <p>We use Ansible for automating the deployment of the EESSI software stack. Terraform is used for creating cloud instances which are used for development, building software, and testing. We also employ ReFrame for testing the different layers of the EESSI project, and the provided installations of scientific software applications. Finally, we use Singularity containers for having clean software build environments and for providing easy access to our software stack, for instance on machines without a native CernVM-FS client.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we will present how the EESSI project grew out of a need for more collaboration to tackle the challenges in the changing landscape of scientific software and HPC system architectures. The project structure will be explained in more detail, covering the motivation for the layered approach and the choice of tools, as well as the lessons learned from the work done by Compute Canada. The goals we have in mind and how we plan to achieve them going forward will be outlined.</p>

      <p>Finally, we will demonstrate the current pilot version of the project, and give you a feeling of the potential impact.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Here we give a more extensive overview of the free and open-source software that EESSI depends on, and how they are being used in the project.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Ansible</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Ansible (https://www.ansible.com/) is a tool for automation and configuration management. We use Ansible for automating the deployment of the EESSI software stack. This includes, for instance, the installation and configuration of all CernVM-FS components, installing Gentoo Prefix on different CPU architectures, and adding our packages and customizations to the Gentoo Prefix installation.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>archspec</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Archspec (https://github.com/archspec/archspec) is a Python library for detecting, querying, and comparing the architecture of a system. In EESSI it is used to find the CPU type of the host system and the software stack in the repository that best matches the host CPU microarchitecture. In the future, we will also use the library to do the same for GPUs.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>CernVM-FS</li>
      </ul>


      <p>CernVM-FS (https://cernvm.cern.ch/fs/) is a software distribution service that provides a scalable, read-only, globally distributed filesystem. Clients can mount this filesystem over HTTP. We use CernVM-FS to make the scientific software stack available to any client around the world.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Cluster-in-the-Cloud</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Cluster-in-the-Cloud (https://cluster-in-the-cloud.readthedocs.io/) is a tool that allows you to easily set up a scalable and heterogeneous cluster in the cloud. We leverage this tool to automate software builds on specific architectures, and to test the software installations.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>EasyBuild</li>
      </ul>


      <p>EasyBuild (https://easybuilders.github.io/easybuild/) is an installation tool for scientific software, currently supporting over 2,000 packages. By default, EasyBuild optimizes the software for the build host system. We use EasyBuild to install all the different scientific software that we want to include in our stack, and for all the different architectures that we want to support.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Gentoo Prefix</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Gentoo Prefix (https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Prefix) is a Linux distribution that is built from source and can be installed in a given path (the “prefix”). It supports many different architectures, including x86_64, Arm64, POWER, and can be used on both Linux and macOS systems.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Lmod</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Lmod (https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/research-development/tacc-projects/lmod) is an environment modules tool written in Lua, which is used on many different HPC systems to give users intuitive access to software installations. It also allows you to have multiple software versions side-by-side. The EESSI software stack includes an installation of Lmod and environment module files for each scientific software application and its dependencies, providing easy access to those installations to end users.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>ReFrame</li>
      </ul>


      <p>ReFrame (https://reframe-hpc.readthedocs.io/) is a high-level regression testing framework for HPC systems. EESSI will be using ReFrame to implement tests (written in Python) for verifying the correctness of the different layers of our project, and doing performance checks of software installations.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Singularity</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Singularity (https://sylabs.io/singularity/) is a container platform that was created to run complex applications on HPC systems. We use it to set up isolated build environments on different kinds of systems, without requiring root privileges. Furthermore, we use it to provide clients with a way to easily access our repository, without having to install a CernVM-FS client.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Terraform</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Terraform (https://www.terraform.io/) is a tool that enables you to easily set up clond instances on demand. We use it to do exactly that, for instance for build machines.</p>

    abstract: |-
      <p>This talk introduces DiscoPoP, a tool which identifies parallelization opportunities in sequential programs and suggests programmers how to parallelize them using OpenMP. The tool first identifies computational units which, in our terminology, are the atoms of parallelization. Then, it profiles memory accesses inside the source code to detect data dependencies. Mapping dependencies to CUs, we create a data structure which we call the program execution tree (PET). Further, DiscoPoP inspects the pet of a program to find parallel design patterns and parallelization suggestions in terms of OpenMP constructs and clauses. By far, DiscoPoP detects doall, reduction, pipeline, task parallelism, and geometric decomposition in a program.</p>

      <p>We used DiscoPoP to create OpenMP versions of 49 sequential benchmarks and compared them with the code produced by three state-of-the-art parallelization tools: Our codes are faster in most cases with average speedups relative to any of the three ranging from 1.8 to 2.7. Moreover, we analyzed the LULESH program and an astrophysics simulation code with DiscoPoP. In LULESH, we identify most of the parallelization opportunities which have been parallelized by expert programmers manually. In the astrophysics code, DiscoPoP finds unexploited parallelism opportunities and achieves a speed-up of up to 35%.</p>

      <p>DiscoPoP is released as an open source software and can be downloaded from:</p>

    description: |-
      <p>XL is a programming language with an homoiconic representation of programs using 8 node types. There is only one fundamental operator describing parse tree rewrites. This design allows this very minimalist language to read like a relatively normal programming language, while offering very powerful Lisp-like meta-programming capabilities.</p>

      <p>Unlike Lisp, however, the design of XL is guided by an approach called "concept programming", which focuses on the process of turning ideas into code. This means that it is a core objective to make the code "look like" and "behave like" the ideas it represents. But keeping things simple for us humans turns out to be extremely complicated for a computer.</p>

      <p>The purpose of this talk is to share some of the insights gained with XL, in the area of syntax, semantics and code generation, with the hope that it will be useful to people working on other languages as well. The discussion will be based on five simple examples:</p>

      <ol>
      <li>numbers, expressions, statements and other program structures</li>
      <li>minimum, maximum and other non-objects</li>

      <li>text formatting and other I/Os</li>
      <li>complex numbers and other data types</li>

      <p>In each case, we will deep-dive, starting with the limitations of mainstream languages and give examples of subtle bugs caused by these limitations. We will then explore the approach XL takes to solve some of these issues, which is often, comparatively, extremely simple and minimalist.</p>

      <p>Fuzzy Sync was developed for reproducing Linux kernel bugs, however it may be used to collide events in user land, another kernel or other contexts. No particular kernel features or instrumentation are required. The Linux Test Project is a large test suite for the Linux kernel and POSIX. Most of the tests are stand alone executables which run in user land and interact with some low level kernel interface. Fuzzy Sync is primarily used in regression tests which attempt to reproduce a particular bug. This ensures the bug is not reintroduced and indicates if a patch needs back porting to older kernels.</p>

      <p>This talk gives an overview of the various open source HPC-related research projects at the Institute for Scientific Computing at TU Darmstadt.
      For each of the projects, we present an overview of the tool and its application from a user perspective.
      In addition, we cover more technical details, e.g., main programming language, build system or the general development stack.
      We have consolidated our efforts into a single GitHub space at https://github.com/tudasc.</p>

      <p>MACH
      MACH (MPI Assertion Checking) is a Clang/LLVM-based static analysis tool to detect if one of the recently proposed MPI-assertions can be applied to an MPI communicator.
      A programmer may specify these assertions, such that the MPI Library can use more optimized operations, as some of the standard's constraints are relaxed in that case, e.g., strict message ordering.
      MACH statically checks whether the relaxation of some of the MPI standard's guarantees will cause errors in an application.
      The current version supports C and C++ applications, with the scope of the analysis being limited to one translation unit.
      The project is available under the Apache-2.0 License.</p>

      <p>PIRA
      The Performance Instrumentation Refinement Automation framework is a profiler built on top of Clang/LLVM and Score-P.
      It performs automatic instrumentation refinement for performance measurements of sequential and MPI-parallel applications.
      To reduce runtime overhead it constructs, fully automatically, filter lists for Score-P based on static source-code features and profile information.
      The project is available under BSD 3-clause license.</p>

      <p>SimAnMo
      The Simulated Annealing Modeler is a software tool to model the runtime behavior of programs depending on the size of one input parameter x.
      Its modeling procedure is based on runtime measurements for small values of x which result in acceptable runtimes and are so-called training points.
      SimAnMo supports modeling for programs with polynomial behavior, i.e., the program's runtime t(x) only grows in polynomial terms with the size of the input x.
      In addition, SimAnMo recognizes and models and exponential growth in the runtime.
      SimAnMo is highly configurable and parameterizable and automatically produces PDF reports of runtime behavior.
      The project is available under the MIT License.</p>

      <p>TypeART
      TypeART is a memory type sanitizer based on the LLVM compiler framework.
      In particular, TypeART ist used for type correctness checks of MPI communication buffers and checkpointing libraries.
      In both cases, data is passed as a type-less void buffer, and the user is required to specify its type manually.
      This is error prone.
      To avoid a mismatch of types during runtime, TypeART instruments memory allocations (heap, stack, global) and extracts their type information to enable runtime comparisons.
      Detected mismatches are reported at runtime.
      The project is available under BSD 3-clause license.</p>

      <p>Despite best intentions, Open Source releases with regression errors are published every day. In the best case scenario, a downstream user detects it early thanks to good tests, files an issue, and the maintainer can fix it before too many people have upgraded. Other scenarios involve various degrees of brokenness and games of "is it broken for everyone or just me?".</p>

      <p>Renovate Bot is an open source dependency automation tool but which also is run as a free app on github.com, where it is installed into almost 200,000 repositories. A feature called "Merge Confidence" helps downstream users know if a release is likely good or not based on automatically sourced crowd data (tests, deployments, rollbacks). Now we are planning to turn the focus upstream to help open source maintainers get an early indication of accidentally breaking releases and even provide a mechanism for downstream users to opt into silent pre-release testing so that major features can be smoke tested downstream before release.</p>

      if a bad character is inserted? What if there is no transaction in the script?
      What if you run the migration on the wrong database? It works, sometimes. Lots
      of tasks are boring. This one was on top of our list. In this talk, you will
      discover our feedback on how we have reduced efforts, time and human errors
      by automating databases schema migrations using git, code reviews, CI/CD, migration
      tools, service discovery and automation systems at the OVHcloud scale.</p>

      <p>Fuzion is a modern general purpose programming language that unifies concepts
      found in structured, functional and object-oriented programming languages into
      the concept of a Fuzion feature.  It combines a powerful syntax and safety
      features based on the design-by-contract principle with a simple intermediate
      representation that enables powerful optimizing compilers and static analysis
      tools to verify correctness aspects.</p>

      <p>Fuzion was influenced by many other languages including Java, Python, Eiffel,
      Rust, Go, Lua, Kotlin, C#, F#, Nim, Julia, Clojure, C/C++, and many more.  The
      goal of Fuzion is to define a language that has the expressive power present in
      these languages and allow high-performance implementation and powerful analysis
      tools.  Furthermore, Fuzion addresses requirements for safety-critical
      applications by adding support for contracts that enable formal specification and
      enable detailed control over runtime checks.</p>

      <p>The talk will explain Fuzion's motivation and present its main concepts, feature
      declarations and feature calls.  It will not go into details of the syntax, but
      present Fuzion's approach to immutability, memory management and type inference.</p>
    description: |-
      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>Many current programming language are getting more and more overloaded with new
      concepts and syntax to solve particular development or performance issues.
      Languages like Java/C# provide classes, interfaces, methods, packages, anonymous
      inner classes, local variables, fields, closures, etc.  And these languages are
      currently further extended by the introductions of records/structs, value types,
      etc.  The possibility for nesting of these different concepts results in
      complexity for the developer and the tools (compilers, VMs) that process and
      execute the code.</p>

      <p>For example, the possibility to access a local variable as part of the closure
      of a lambda expression may result in the compiler allocating heap space to hold
      the contents of that local variable.  Hence, the developer has lost control over
      the allocation decisions made by the compiler.</p>

      <p>In Fuzion, the concepts of classes, interfaces, methods, packages, fields and
      local variables are unified in the concept of a Fuzion feature. The decision
      where to allocate the memory associated with a feature (on the heap, the stack
      or in a register) is left to the compiler just as well as the decision if
      dynamic type information is needed.  The developer is left with the single
      concept of a feature, the language implementation takes care for all the rest.</p>

      <h1>Fuzion Feature Declarations</h1>

      <p>A Fuzion feature is has a name, similar to the name of a class or a function.
      The main operation that can be performed on a feature is a feature call.  The
      constituents of a feature declaration are as follows:</p>

      <h2>Formal Arguments</h2>

      <p>Features may have a list of formal arguments, which are themselves features
      implemented as fields.  On a call to a feature with formal arguments, actual
      arguments have to be provided to the call, unless the list of formal arguments
      is empty.</p>

      <h2>Feature Result</h2>

      <p>The result of a feature call is an instance of the feature.  Alternatively, a
      feature may declare a different result type, then it must return a value of that
      type on a call.</p>

      <h2>Closures</h2>

      <p>Features are nested, i.e., every feature is declared within the context of an
      outer feature.  The only exception is the universe, which is the outermost
      feature in any Fuzion system.  A feature can access features declared in its
      outer feature or, recursively, any outer feature of these outer features.  This
      means, a feature declaration also declares a closure of the feature and its
      context.</p>

      <p>When calling a feature <em>f1</em> declared as an inner feature of <em>f2</em>, the call must
      include a target value which is the result of a call to <em>f2</em>, e.g., <em>f2.f1</em>.</p>

      <h2>Generics</h2>

      <p>Features may have generic type parameters. E.g. a feature declaration may leave
      the actual type used within that feature open and to be defined by the user of
      the feature.</p>

      <p>The list of generic type parameters may be open, i.e., the number of actual
      generic type parameters is not fixed at feature declaration.  This turns out to
      be useful in he declaration of choice types or functions explained below.</p>

      <h2>Inheritance</h2>

      <p>Fuzion features can inherit from one or several other features.  When inheriting
      from an existing features, all inner features of the parent automatically become
      inner features of the heir feature.  It is possible to redefine inherited
      features.  In particular, when inheriting from a feature with abstract inner
      features, one can implement the inherited abstract features.</p>

      <p>A redefinition of an inherited feature may implement an inherited feature as a
      routine or as a field.  An inherited feature that is implemented as a field,
      however, cannot be redefined.</p>

      <p>Inheritance may result in conflicts, e.g. if two features with the same name are
      inherited from two different parents.  In this case, the heir must resolve the
      conflict either by redefining the inherited features and providing a new
      implementation or by renaming the inherited features resulting in two inner
      features in the heir feature.</p>

      <p>Inheritance and redefinition in Fuzion does not require dynamic binding.  By
      default, the types defined by features are value types and no run-time overhead
      for dynamic binding is imposed by inheritance.</p>

      <h2>Contract</h2>

      <p>A feature may declare a contract that specifies what the features does and under
      which conditions the feature may be called. This will be handled in more detail
      below in the section <em>Design by Contract</em>.</p>

      <h2>An implementaton</h2>

      <p>Features must have one of the following implementations</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>a routine is a feature implementation with code that is executed on a call</p></li>
      <li><p>a field is a memory slot that stores a value and whose contents are returned on a call</p></li>
      <li><p>an abstract feature has no implementation and cannot be called directly, but can be implemented by heir features</p></li>
      <li><p>an intrinsic feature is a low-level feature implemented by the compiler or
      run-time system, e.g., the infix + operator to add two 32-bit integer values
      may be an intrinsic operation.</p></li>
      </ul>


      <p>A feature implemented as a routine can contain inner feature declarations.</p>

      <h1>Feature examples</h1>

      <p>Here is an example that declares a feature <em>point</em> that functions similar to s
      struct or record in other languages:</p>

      <pre><code>point(x, y i32) is # empty
      p1 := point(3, 4)
      stdout.println("p1.x is " + p1.x)    # will print "p1.x is 3"
      stdout.println("p1.y is " + p1.y)    # will print "p1.y is 4"
      </code></pre>

      <p>The next example show a feature <em>base</em> that provides an innver feature <em>plus</em>
      that adds its argument to the value passed to the enclosing base:</p>

      <pre><code>base(v i32) is
        plus(w i32) =&gt; v + w

      b1 := base(30)
      b2 := base(100)
      stdout.println(b1.plus(23))    # will print "53"
      stdout.println(b2.plus(23))    # will print "123"
      </code></pre>

      <h1>Features and Types</h1>

      <p>A feature declaration implicitly declares a type of its instances. In the
      example above, the feature declaration</p>

      <pre><code>point(x, y i32) is
      </code></pre>

      <p>declares the type <em>point</em> that can be used to declare a feature of field type, so
      we could, e.g., declare a new feature that takes an argument of type <em>point</em>:</p>

      <pre><code>draw(p point) is
        drawPixel(p.x, p.y)
      </code></pre>

      <h1>Syntactic Sugar</h1>

      <p>Fuzion's grammar adds syntactic sugar that simplifies the developers work by
      making code more readable and easier to write. However, internally, this
      syntactic sugar is converted into feature declarations and feature calls.
      Consequently, only the front-end of the language implementation is affected, the
      later phases that optimize, analyse, compiler, interpret, etc. the code are not
      affected by this.</p>

      <h2>Loops</h2>

      <p>Fuzion has a very powerful syntax for loops, an overview is given at
      <a href="https://flang.dev/tutorial/loops">flang.dev</a>.  However, loops are purely
      syntactic sugar and get translated into feature declarations and calls.  This
      has important impact for the immutability of variables as will be explained
      below.  Since the compiler performs optimizations for tail recursive calls, the
      resulting performance will be equal to inline loops.</p>

      <h2>Choice Types</h2>

      <p>Fuzion provides choice types (also called union types, sum types, tagged types,
      co-product types in other languages).  A choice type is a feature declared in the
      standard library that has an open list of generic parameters for a number of
      actual types a field of this choice type may hold.</p>

      <p>The simplest example of a choice type is the type <em>bool</em>, which is a choice
      between types <em>TRUE</em> and <em>FALSE</em>.  <em>TRUE</em> and <em>FALSE</em> are themselves declared as
      features with no state, i.e., no fields containing any data.</p>

      <p>Another example for a choice type from the standard library is <em>Option&lt;T></em>,
      which is a generic choice type that either holds a value of type <em>T</em> or <em>nil</em>,
      while <em>nil</em> is a feature with no state declared in the standard library.</p>

      <p>A match statement can be used to distinguish the different options in a choice
      type, e.g.,</p>

      <pre><code>mayBeString Option&lt;string&gt; = someCall()
      match mayBeString
        s String =&gt; stdout.println(s)
        _ nil    =&gt; stdout.println("no string")
      </code></pre>

      <p>The ? operator allows for more compact syntax, the following code is equivalent</p>

      <pre><code>stdout.println(mayBeString ? s | "no string")
      </code></pre>

      <p>while a single ? may be used to return immediately from the current feature in
      case of an error</p>

      <pre><code>stdout.println(mayBeString?)    # return nil immediately if mayBeString is nil
      </code></pre>

      <p>which works only within a feature that may return the unhandled types as a
      result.</p>

      <h2>First-class Function</h2>

      <p>Another open generic type in the standard library is Function.  This is a
      feature that declares an abstract inner feature <em>call</em>.  Syntactic sugar in the
      Fuzion front-end enables inline declaration of functions as shown in this example:</p>

      <pre><code>fun_example is

        eval(msg string, f fun (i32) i32) is
          for
            x in 0..3
            m := msg, ", "
          do
            y := f(x)
            stdout.print("" + m + "f(" + x + ") = " + y)
          stdout.println

        eval("f(x) = 2*x:   ", fun (x i32) =&gt; 2*x)
        eval("f(x) = x*x:   ", fun (x i32) =&gt; x*x)
        eval("f(x) = x*x*x: ", fun (x i32) =&gt; x*x*x)
      </code></pre>

      <p>which results in</p>

      <pre><code>f(x) = 2*x:   f(0) = 0, f(1) = 2, f(2) = 4, f(3) = 6
      f(x) = x*x:   f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 4, f(3) = 9
      f(x) = x*x*x: f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 8, f(3) = 27
      </code></pre>

      <p>Internally, function declarations are implemented as inner features.  Since a
      feature declaration defines a closure, a function declarations also defines the
      function closure.</p>

      <h2>Tuples</h2>

      <p>Tuples in Fuzion are provided by a generic standard library feature <em>Tuple</em>.
      The open list of generic parameters specifies the types of each element and
      their number.</p>

      <p>Here is an examples of a feature that splits a 32-bit unsigned integer <em>v</em> into
      four bytes returned as a tuple:</p>

      <pre><code>bytes(v u32) =&gt; ((v &gt;&gt; 24) ,
                       (v &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 255,
                       (v &gt;&gt;  8) &amp; 255,
                       (v      ) &amp; 255)
      </code></pre>

      <p>A caller might directly decompose this tuple when calling <em>bytes</em>:</p>

      <pre><code>(b0, b1, b2, b3) := bytes(1234567890)

      stdout.println("Bytes: " + b0 + " " + b1 + " " + b2 + " " + b3 + " ")
      </code></pre>

      <h1>References</h1>

      <p>By default, Fusion types have value semantics.  This means that a value
      cannot be assigned to a field whose type is a parent type of the value's type.
      However, a value can be marked as a reference by adding the keyword <em>ref</em>.  Then,
      any value of a heir type can be assigned to this field.</p>

      <p>An example is the argument of the <em>println</em> feature, which is a ref to an
      <em>Object</em>.  Its implementation is shown here:</p>

      <pre><code>public println(s ref Object) void is
        for c in s.asString.asBytes do
          write(c)
        println
      </code></pre>

      <p><em>Object</em> is the implicit parent feature of all features that do not explicitly
      declare a parent.  Consequently, any value can be assigned to the argument <em>s</em>
      of println.</p>

      <p>Object declares some basic features such as <em>asString</em>, which creates a <em>string</em>
      representation of the <em>Object</em>.  Redefinitions of these functions in heir features
      such as <em>integer</em> provide useful string representations of the objects.</p>

      <p>Note that the <em>ref</em> keyword does not require that the implementation would
      allocate the value passed as a ref on the heap and it also does not imply that
      we will have dynamic type information and dynamic binding at run-time.  Instead,
      these overheads can be avoided by stack allocation and specialization.</p>

      <h1>Design by Contract</h1>

      <p>Fuzion features can be equipped with pre- and post-conditions to formally
      document the requirements that must be met when a feature is called and the
      guarantees given by a feature.  An example is a feature that implements a square
      root function:</p>

      <pre><code>sqrt(a i32) i32
        pre
          a &gt;= 0
        post
          result * result &lt;= a,
          (result + 1) &gt; a / (result + 1),
          result &gt;= 0
      is
        if a == 0
          0
        else
          for
            last := 0, r
            r    := 1, (last +^ a / last) / 2
          until r == last
      </code></pre>

      <p>In this case, the function defines the pre-condition that its argument <em>a</em> is
      non-negative.  A call of this function with a negative value will result in a
      run-time error.  On the other hand, its post-conditions make a clear statement
      about the result: The result will be the largest value that, when squared, is &lt;=
      a.</p>

      <h2>Checking Pre- and Post-conditions</h2>

      <p>Pre- and post-conditions can be classified for different purposes. Default
      qualifiers provided in the standard library are</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p><em>safety</em></p>

      <p>This qualifier protects pre-conditions that are required for the safety of an operation.</p>

      <p>An example is the index check pre-condition of the intrinsic operation to
      access an element of an array: Not performing the index check would allow
      arbitrary memory accesses and typically would break the applications safety.</p>

      <p>This qualifier should therefore never be disabled unless you are running code
      in an environment where performance is essential and safety is irrelevant.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>debug</em></p>

      <p>This qualifier is generally for debugging, it is set iff debugging is
      enabled.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>debug(n)</em></p>

      <p>this qualifier is specific for enabling checks at a given debug level, where
      higher levels include more and more expensive checks.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>pedantic</em></p>

      <p>This qualifier is for conditions that a pedantic purist would require, that
      otherwise a more relaxed hacker would prefer to do without.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>analysis</em></p>

      <p>This is a qualifier for conditions that are generally not reasonable as
      run-time checks, either because they are prohibitively expensive or even not
      at all computable in this finite universe. These conditions may, however, be
      very useful for formal analysis tools that do not execute the code but
      perform techniques such as abstract interpretation or formal deduction to
      reason about the code.</p></li>
      </ul>


      <p>Run-time checks for pre- and post-conditions can be enabled or disabled for each
      of these qualifiers.  This gives a fine-grain control over the kind of checks
      that are desired at run-time.  Usually, one would always want to keep safety
      checks enabled in a system that processed data provided from the outside to
      avoid vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows.  However, in a closed system
      like a rocket controller, it might make sense to disable checks since a run-time
      error would mean definite loss of the mission, while an unexpected intermediate
      value may still result in a useful final result of a calculation.</p>

      <h1>Immutability in Fuzion</h1>

      <p>Fuzion encourages the use of immutable data by simple syntax for the declaration
      of immutable fields.  Also, the use of tail recursion for loops automatically
      converts index variables used in that loop into immutable variables with a life
      span of a single loop iteration.</p>

      <p>Since immutability is essential to ensure correctness of parallel execution
      within threads that do not rely on locks or similar synchronization mechanisms,
      Fuzion's analyser will require data that is shared between threads to be
      immutable.</p>

      <h1>Memory Management in Fuzion</h1>

      <p>Fuzion to a large extend relies on static analysis to reduce memory management
      overhead.  Instances are by default value instances that do not require heap
      allocation.  Furthermore, immutability in many cases avoids the need to keep a
      shared copy on the heap.</p>

      <p>For dynamic calls, heap allocation and dynamic binding overhead is avoided by
      specialization of calls.</p>

      <p>Only for those instances for which all of these optimizations would fail, in
      particular instances shared between threads or long-lived instances with mutable
      fields, heap allocation will be required.</p>

      <p>Memory allocated on the heap will be reclaimed by a real-time garbage collector,
      an example means to provide this is the real-time GC presented at <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1806651.1806654">ISMM'10:
      Concurrent, parallel, real-time
      garbage-collection</a>.</p>

      <h1>Type Inference</h1>

      <p>Fuzion is a statically types language. However, type inference is used to avoid
      the need to explicitly provide types for fields, for function results and for
      actual generic parameters.  Furthermore, the type of constant numeric expression
      is propagated from target the expression's value is assigned to.</p>

      <p>For the type inference for fields and function results, a dedicated phase in
      Fuzion's front-end lazily determines the types of expressions.  This phase also
      detects possible cycles in the type inferencing and flags these as errors if
      encountered.</p>

      <p>For interference of actual generic parameters, the types of actual arguments
      passed the the generic feature are used.  This, however, works only for generic
      features that use the generic types within their formal argument lists.</p>

      <h1>Fuzion Implementation</h1>

      <p>The Fuzion implementation consists of several, independent parts from a
      front-end performing parsing and syntax-related tasks and creates the
      intermediate representation (IR), via a middle-end that collects the part of a
      Fuzion application, to the optimizer and several back-ends.</p>

      <h2>Fuzion IR</h2>

      <p>Fuzion has very simple intermediate representation. The dominant instruction is
      a feature call.  The only control structure is a conditional (if) operation.
      Loops are replaced by tail recursive feature calls, so there is no need in the
      compiler or analysis tools to handle loops as long as (tail-) recursion is
      provided.</p>

      <p>The largest part of a compiler back-end consists of providing target-platform
      specific implementations for all intrinsic features declared in the Fuzion
      standard library.</p>

      <h2>Fuzion Optimizer</h2>

      <p>The Fuzion Optimizer modifies the intermediate representation of a Fuzion
      application.  In particular, it determines the life spans of values to decide if
      they can be stack allocated or need to be heap allocated and it specializes
      feature implementations for the actual argument types and the actual generic
      arguments provided at each call.</p>

      <p>This means that run-time overhead for heap allocation and garbage collection will
      be avoided as much as possible, most values can be allocated on the run-time
      stack.  Additionally, run-time type information such as vtables will be required
      only in very few cases where dynamic binding cannot be avoided. An example is a
      data structure like a list of some reference type with elements of different
      actual types that are stored in this list.</p>

      <h2>Fuzion Back-Ends</h2>

      <p>Fuzion currently has two back-ends: An interpreter written in Java running on
      OpenJDK and a back-end creating C source code processed by gcc or clang.  It is
      planned to add further back-ends, in particular for LLVM and Java bytecode.</p>

      <h1>Next Steps</h1>

      <p>The Fuzion language definition and implementation is still in an early stage.
      It is planned to publish a first version of the language and its implementation
      at FOSDEM 2021.  But a lot of work remains to be done, in particular, for Fuzion
      to be successful, it will need</p>

      <ul>
      <li>a powerful standard library</li>
      <li>additional library modules for all sorts of application needs</li>
      <li>powerful interfaces to other languages such as Java, C, Python, etc.</li>
      <li>highly optimizing back-ends</li>
      <li>IDE integration</li>
      <li>documentation, tutorials</li>
      <li>much more</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Also, professional services around Fuzion will be required for acceptance
      outside the open-source community.  The Tokiwa SW GmbH currently leads the
      development of Fuzion and plans to provide professional services as well.</p>

      <p>Fuzion is a modern general purpose programming language that unifies concepts
      found in structured, functional and object-oriented programming languages into
      the concept of a Fuzion feature.  It combines a powerful syntax and safety
      features based on the design-by-contract principle with a simple intermediate
      representation that enables powerful optimizing compilers and static analysis
      tools to verify correctness aspects.</p>

      <p>Fuzion was influenced by many other languages including Java, Python, Eiffel,
      Rust, Go, Lua, Kotlin, C#, F#, Nim, Julia, Clojure, C/C++, and many more.  The
      goal of Fuzion is to define a language that has the expressive power present in
      these languages and allow high-performance implementation and powerful analysis
      tools.  Furthermore, Fuzion addresses requirements for safety-critical
      applications by adding support for contracts that enable formal specification and
      enable detailed control over runtime checks.</p>

      <p>The talk will explain Fuzion's motivation and present its main concepts, feature
      declarations and feature calls.  It will not go into details of the syntax, but
      present Fuzion's approach to immutability, memory management and type inference.</p>
    raw_description: |-
      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>Many current programming language are getting more and more overloaded with new
      concepts and syntax to solve particular development or performance issues.
      Languages like Java/C# provide classes, interfaces, methods, packages, anonymous
      inner classes, local variables, fields, closures, etc.  And these languages are
      currently further extended by the introductions of records/structs, value types,
      etc.  The possibility for nesting of these different concepts results in
      complexity for the developer and the tools (compilers, VMs) that process and
      execute the code.</p>

      <p>For example, the possibility to access a local variable as part of the closure
      of a lambda expression may result in the compiler allocating heap space to hold
      the contents of that local variable.  Hence, the developer has lost control over
      the allocation decisions made by the compiler.</p>

      <p>In Fuzion, the concepts of classes, interfaces, methods, packages, fields and
      local variables are unified in the concept of a Fuzion feature. The decision
      where to allocate the memory associated with a feature (on the heap, the stack
      or in a register) is left to the compiler just as well as the decision if
      dynamic type information is needed.  The developer is left with the single
      concept of a feature, the language implementation takes care for all the rest.</p>

      <h1>Fuzion Feature Declarations</h1>

      <p>A Fuzion feature is has a name, similar to the name of a class or a function.
      The main operation that can be performed on a feature is a feature call.  The
      constituents of a feature declaration are as follows:</p>

      <h2>Formal Arguments</h2>

      <p>Features may have a list of formal arguments, which are themselves features
      implemented as fields.  On a call to a feature with formal arguments, actual
      arguments have to be provided to the call, unless the list of formal arguments
      is empty.</p>

      <h2>Feature Result</h2>

      <p>The result of a feature call is an instance of the feature.  Alternatively, a
      feature may declare a different result type, then it must return a value of that
      type on a call.</p>

      <h2>Closures</h2>

      <p>Features are nested, i.e., every feature is declared within the context of an
      outer feature.  The only exception is the universe, which is the outermost
      feature in any Fuzion system.  A feature can access features declared in its
      outer feature or, recursively, any outer feature of these outer features.  This
      means, a feature declaration also declares a closure of the feature and its
      context.</p>

      <p>When calling a feature <em>f1</em> declared as an inner feature of <em>f2</em>, the call must
      include a target value which is the result of a call to <em>f2</em>, e.g., <em>f2.f1</em>.</p>

      <h2>Generics</h2>

      <p>Features may have generic type parameters. E.g. a feature declaration may leave
      the actual type used within that feature open and to be defined by the user of
      the feature.</p>

      <p>The list of generic type parameters may be open, i.e., the number of actual
      generic type parameters is not fixed at feature declaration.  This turns out to
      be useful in he declaration of choice types or functions explained below.</p>

      <h2>Inheritance</h2>

      <p>Fuzion features can inherit from one or several other features.  When inheriting
      from an existing features, all inner features of the parent automatically become
      inner features of the heir feature.  It is possible to redefine inherited
      features.  In particular, when inheriting from a feature with abstract inner
      features, one can implement the inherited abstract features.</p>

      <p>A redefinition of an inherited feature may implement an inherited feature as a
      routine or as a field.  An inherited feature that is implemented as a field,
      however, cannot be redefined.</p>

      <p>Inheritance may result in conflicts, e.g. if two features with the same name are
      inherited from two different parents.  In this case, the heir must resolve the
      conflict either by redefining the inherited features and providing a new
      implementation or by renaming the inherited features resulting in two inner
      features in the heir feature.</p>

      <p>Inheritance and redefinition in Fuzion does not require dynamic binding.  By
      default, the types defined by features are value types and no run-time overhead
      for dynamic binding is imposed by inheritance.</p>

      <h2>Contract</h2>

      <p>A feature may declare a contract that specifies what the features does and under
      which conditions the feature may be called. This will be handled in more detail
      below in the section <em>Design by Contract</em>.</p>

      <h2>An implementaton</h2>

      <p>Features must have one of the following implementations</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>a routine is a feature implementation with code that is executed on a call</p></li>
      <li><p>a field is a memory slot that stores a value and whose contents are returned on a call</p></li>
      <li><p>an abstract feature has no implementation and cannot be called directly, but can be implemented by heir features</p></li>
      <li><p>an intrinsic feature is a low-level feature implemented by the compiler or
      run-time system, e.g., the infix + operator to add two 32-bit integer values
      may be an intrinsic operation.</p></li>
      </ul>


      <p>A feature implemented as a routine can contain inner feature declarations.</p>

      <h1>Feature examples</h1>

      <p>Here is an example that declares a feature <em>point</em> that functions similar to s
      struct or record in other languages:</p>

      <pre><code>point(x, y i32) is # empty
      p1 := point(3, 4)
      stdout.println("p1.x is " + p1.x)    # will print "p1.x is 3"
      stdout.println("p1.y is " + p1.y)    # will print "p1.y is 4"
      </code></pre>

      <p>The next example show a feature <em>base</em> that provides an innver feature <em>plus</em>
      that adds its argument to the value passed to the enclosing base:</p>

      <pre><code>base(v i32) is
        plus(w i32) =&gt; v + w

      b1 := base(30)
      b2 := base(100)
      stdout.println(b1.plus(23))    # will print "53"
      stdout.println(b2.plus(23))    # will print "123"
      </code></pre>

      <h1>Features and Types</h1>

      <p>A feature declaration implicitly declares a type of its instances. In the
      example above, the feature declaration</p>

      <pre><code>point(x, y i32) is
      </code></pre>

      <p>declares the type <em>point</em> that can be used to declare a feature of field type, so
      we could, e.g., declare a new feature that takes an argument of type <em>point</em>:</p>

      <pre><code>draw(p point) is
        drawPixel(p.x, p.y)
      </code></pre>

      <h1>Syntactic Sugar</h1>

      <p>Fuzion's grammar adds syntactic sugar that simplifies the developers work by
      making code more readable and easier to write. However, internally, this
      syntactic sugar is converted into feature declarations and feature calls.
      Consequently, only the front-end of the language implementation is affected, the
      later phases that optimize, analyse, compiler, interpret, etc. the code are not
      affected by this.</p>

      <h2>Loops</h2>

      <p>Fuzion has a very powerful syntax for loops, an overview is given at
      <a href="https://flang.dev/tutorial/loops">flang.dev</a>.  However, loops are purely
      syntactic sugar and get translated into feature declarations and calls.  This
      has important impact for the immutability of variables as will be explained
      below.  Since the compiler performs optimizations for tail recursive calls, the
      resulting performance will be equal to inline loops.</p>

      <h2>Choice Types</h2>

      <p>Fuzion provides choice types (also called union types, sum types, tagged types,
      co-product types in other languages).  A choice type is a feature declared in the
      standard library that has an open list of generic parameters for a number of
      actual types a field of this choice type may hold.</p>

      <p>The simplest example of a choice type is the type <em>bool</em>, which is a choice
      between types <em>TRUE</em> and <em>FALSE</em>.  <em>TRUE</em> and <em>FALSE</em> are themselves declared as
      features with no state, i.e., no fields containing any data.</p>

      <p>Another example for a choice type from the standard library is <em>Option&lt;T></em>,
      which is a generic choice type that either holds a value of type <em>T</em> or <em>nil</em>,
      while <em>nil</em> is a feature with no state declared in the standard library.</p>

      <p>A match statement can be used to distinguish the different options in a choice
      type, e.g.,</p>

      <pre><code>mayBeString Option&lt;string&gt; = someCall()
      match mayBeString
        s String =&gt; stdout.println(s)
        _ nil    =&gt; stdout.println("no string")
      </code></pre>

      <p>The ? operator allows for more compact syntax, the following code is equivalent</p>

      <pre><code>stdout.println(mayBeString ? s | "no string")
      </code></pre>

      <p>while a single ? may be used to return immediately from the current feature in
      case of an error</p>

      <pre><code>stdout.println(mayBeString?)    # return nil immediately if mayBeString is nil
      </code></pre>

      <p>which works only within a feature that may return the unhandled types as a
      result.</p>

      <h2>First-class Function</h2>

      <p>Another open generic type in the standard library is Function.  This is a
      feature that declares an abstract inner feature <em>call</em>.  Syntactic sugar in the
      Fuzion front-end enables inline declaration of functions as shown in this example:</p>

      <pre><code>fun_example is

        eval(msg string, f fun (i32) i32) is
          for
            x in 0..3
            m := msg, ", "
          do
            y := f(x)
            stdout.print("" + m + "f(" + x + ") = " + y)
          stdout.println

        eval("f(x) = 2*x:   ", fun (x i32) =&gt; 2*x)
        eval("f(x) = x*x:   ", fun (x i32) =&gt; x*x)
        eval("f(x) = x*x*x: ", fun (x i32) =&gt; x*x*x)
      </code></pre>

      <p>which results in</p>

      <pre><code>f(x) = 2*x:   f(0) = 0, f(1) = 2, f(2) = 4, f(3) = 6
      f(x) = x*x:   f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 4, f(3) = 9
      f(x) = x*x*x: f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 8, f(3) = 27
      </code></pre>

      <p>Internally, function declarations are implemented as inner features.  Since a
      feature declaration defines a closure, a function declarations also defines the
      function closure.</p>

      <h2>Tuples</h2>

      <p>Tuples in Fuzion are provided by a generic standard library feature <em>Tuple</em>.
      The open list of generic parameters specifies the types of each element and
      their number.</p>

      <p>Here is an examples of a feature that splits a 32-bit unsigned integer <em>v</em> into
      four bytes returned as a tuple:</p>

      <pre><code>bytes(v u32) =&gt; ((v &gt;&gt; 24) ,
                       (v &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 255,
                       (v &gt;&gt;  8) &amp; 255,
                       (v      ) &amp; 255)
      </code></pre>

      <p>A caller might directly decompose this tuple when calling <em>bytes</em>:</p>

      <pre><code>(b0, b1, b2, b3) := bytes(1234567890)

      stdout.println("Bytes: " + b0 + " " + b1 + " " + b2 + " " + b3 + " ")
      </code></pre>

      <h1>References</h1>

      <p>By default, Fusion types have value semantics.  This means that a value
      cannot be assigned to a field whose type is a parent type of the value's type.
      However, a value can be marked as a reference by adding the keyword <em>ref</em>.  Then,
      any value of a heir type can be assigned to this field.</p>

      <p>An example is the argument of the <em>println</em> feature, which is a ref to an
      <em>Object</em>.  Its implementation is shown here:</p>

      <pre><code>public println(s ref Object) void is
        for c in s.asString.asBytes do
          write(c)
        println
      </code></pre>

      <p><em>Object</em> is the implicit parent feature of all features that do not explicitly
      declare a parent.  Consequently, any value can be assigned to the argument <em>s</em>
      of println.</p>

      <p>Object declares some basic features such as <em>asString</em>, which creates a <em>string</em>
      representation of the <em>Object</em>.  Redefinitions of these functions in heir features
      such as <em>integer</em> provide useful string representations of the objects.</p>

      <p>Note that the <em>ref</em> keyword does not require that the implementation would
      allocate the value passed as a ref on the heap and it also does not imply that
      we will have dynamic type information and dynamic binding at run-time.  Instead,
      these overheads can be avoided by stack allocation and specialization.</p>

      <h1>Design by Contract</h1>

      <p>Fuzion features can be equipped with pre- and post-conditions to formally
      document the requirements that must be met when a feature is called and the
      guarantees given by a feature.  An example is a feature that implements a square
      root function:</p>

      <pre><code>sqrt(a i32) i32
        pre
          a &gt;= 0
        post
          result * result &lt;= a,
          (result + 1) &gt; a / (result + 1),
          result &gt;= 0
      is
        if a == 0
          0
        else
          for
            last := 0, r
            r    := 1, (last +^ a / last) / 2
          until r == last
      </code></pre>

      <p>In this case, the function defines the pre-condition that its argument <em>a</em> is
      non-negative.  A call of this function with a negative value will result in a
      run-time error.  On the other hand, its post-conditions make a clear statement
      about the result: The result will be the largest value that, when squared, is &lt;=
      a.</p>

      <h2>Checking Pre- and Post-conditions</h2>

      <p>Pre- and post-conditions can be classified for different purposes. Default
      qualifiers provided in the standard library are</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p><em>safety</em></p>

      <p>This qualifier protects pre-conditions that are required for the safety of an operation.</p>

      <p>An example is the index check pre-condition of the intrinsic operation to
      access an element of an array: Not performing the index check would allow
      arbitrary memory accesses and typically would break the applications safety.</p>

      <p>This qualifier should therefore never be disabled unless you are running code
      in an environment where performance is essential and safety is irrelevant.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>debug</em></p>

      <p>This qualifier is generally for debugging, it is set iff debugging is
      enabled.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>debug(n)</em></p>

      <p>this qualifier is specific for enabling checks at a given debug level, where
      higher levels include more and more expensive checks.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>pedantic</em></p>

      <p>This qualifier is for conditions that a pedantic purist would require, that
      otherwise a more relaxed hacker would prefer to do without.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>analysis</em></p>

      <p>This is a qualifier for conditions that are generally not reasonable as
      run-time checks, either because they are prohibitively expensive or even not
      at all computable in this finite universe. These conditions may, however, be
      very useful for formal analysis tools that do not execute the code but
      perform techniques such as abstract interpretation or formal deduction to
      reason about the code.</p></li>
      </ul>


      <p>Run-time checks for pre- and post-conditions can be enabled or disabled for each
      of these qualifiers.  This gives a fine-grain control over the kind of checks
      that are desired at run-time.  Usually, one would always want to keep safety
      checks enabled in a system that processed data provided from the outside to
      avoid vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows.  However, in a closed system
      like a rocket controller, it might make sense to disable checks since a run-time
      error would mean definite loss of the mission, while an unexpected intermediate
      value may still result in a useful final result of a calculation.</p>

      <h1>Immutability in Fuzion</h1>

      <p>Fuzion encourages the use of immutable data by simple syntax for the declaration
      of immutable fields.  Also, the use of tail recursion for loops automatically
      converts index variables used in that loop into immutable variables with a life
      span of a single loop iteration.</p>

      <p>Since immutability is essential to ensure correctness of parallel execution
      within threads that do not rely on locks or similar synchronization mechanisms,
      Fuzion's analyser will require data that is shared between threads to be
      immutable.</p>

      <h1>Memory Management in Fuzion</h1>

      <p>Fuzion to a large extend relies on static analysis to reduce memory management
      overhead.  Instances are by default value instances that do not require heap
      allocation.  Furthermore, immutability in many cases avoids the need to keep a
      shared copy on the heap.</p>

      <p>For dynamic calls, heap allocation and dynamic binding overhead is avoided by
      specialization of calls.</p>

      <p>Only for those instances for which all of these optimizations would fail, in
      particular instances shared between threads or long-lived instances with mutable
      fields, heap allocation will be required.</p>

      <p>Memory allocated on the heap will be reclaimed by a real-time garbage collector,
      an example means to provide this is the real-time GC presented at <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1806651.1806654">ISMM'10:
      Concurrent, parallel, real-time
      garbage-collection</a>.</p>

      <h1>Type Inference</h1>

      <p>Fuzion is a statically types language. However, type inference is used to avoid
      the need to explicitly provide types for fields, for function results and for
      actual generic parameters.  Furthermore, the type of constant numeric expression
      is propagated from target the expression's value is assigned to.</p>

      <p>For the type inference for fields and function results, a dedicated phase in
      Fuzion's front-end lazily determines the types of expressions.  This phase also
      detects possible cycles in the type inferencing and flags these as errors if
      encountered.</p>

      <p>For interference of actual generic parameters, the types of actual arguments
      passed the the generic feature are used.  This, however, works only for generic
      features that use the generic types within their formal argument lists.</p>

      <h1>Fuzion Implementation</h1>

      <p>The Fuzion implementation consists of several, independent parts from a
      front-end performing parsing and syntax-related tasks and creates the
      intermediate representation (IR), via a middle-end that collects the part of a
      Fuzion application, to the optimizer and several back-ends.</p>

      <h2>Fuzion IR</h2>

      <p>Fuzion has very simple intermediate representation. The dominant instruction is
      a feature call.  The only control structure is a conditional (if) operation.
      Loops are replaced by tail recursive feature calls, so there is no need in the
      compiler or analysis tools to handle loops as long as (tail-) recursion is
      provided.</p>

      <p>The largest part of a compiler back-end consists of providing target-platform
      specific implementations for all intrinsic features declared in the Fuzion
      standard library.</p>

      <h2>Fuzion Optimizer</h2>

      <p>The Fuzion Optimizer modifies the intermediate representation of a Fuzion
      application.  In particular, it determines the life spans of values to decide if
      they can be stack allocated or need to be heap allocated and it specializes
      feature implementations for the actual argument types and the actual generic
      arguments provided at each call.</p>

      <p>This means that run-time overhead for heap allocation and garbage collection will
      be avoided as much as possible, most values can be allocated on the run-time
      stack.  Additionally, run-time type information such as vtables will be required
      only in very few cases where dynamic binding cannot be avoided. An example is a
      data structure like a list of some reference type with elements of different
      actual types that are stored in this list.</p>

      <h2>Fuzion Back-Ends</h2>

      <p>Fuzion currently has two back-ends: An interpreter written in Java running on
      OpenJDK and a back-end creating C source code processed by gcc or clang.  It is
      planned to add further back-ends, in particular for LLVM and Java bytecode.</p>

      <h1>Next Steps</h1>

      <p>The Fuzion language definition and implementation is still in an early stage.
      It is planned to publish a first version of the language and its implementation
      at FOSDEM 2021.  But a lot of work remains to be done, in particular, for Fuzion
      to be successful, it will need</p>

      <ul>
      <li>a powerful standard library</li>
      <li>additional library modules for all sorts of application needs</li>
      <li>powerful interfaces to other languages such as Java, C, Python, etc.</li>
      <li>highly optimizing back-ends</li>
      <li>IDE integration</li>
      <li>documentation, tutorials</li>
      <li>much more</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Also, professional services around Fuzion will be required for acceptance
      outside the open-source community.  The Tokiwa SW GmbH currently leads the
      development of Fuzion and plans to provide professional services as well.</p>

    description: |-
      <p>WebRTC is well known and widely deployed as a communication technology. Most of the times, though, we hear about it in the context of those same boring and traditional use cases that we've all seen thousands of times: conferencing, e-learning, contact centers, webinars, etc. As a very amateur and hobbyist musician, I've always wondered whether WebRTC could do more to support the arts instead: the answer is obviously a strong yes, and I've always been pleasantly surprised when I've seen it used to that effect.</p>

      <p>Music is indeed one of the areas where WebRTC could do so much more. Since the pandemic started, musicians all over the world were affected in different ways: no more concerts, or meeting the fans, or jam session, and so on and so forth, basically making it much harder for them to earn a living; the same could be said for those who simply love to listen to music, attend concerts and engage with musicians. What can WebRTC do to help, here, and what are the technical challenges that may need to be overcome?</p>

      <p>This presentation will try to cover a few different use cases, ranging from plain streaming/broadcasting (and how WebRTC audio could be improved), tinkering with remote music equipment, playing with friends online and so on. I'll also share some of the experiments I've carried on myself just for fun in this area, the challenges I've identified, and what I'd like to work on next, possibly using the Janus WebRTC Server as a support.</p>

      <p>There are dozens of domain specific languages that allow scientists to describe complex workflows.

All of these systems have one thing in common: they have a strong focus on partitioning large computations and scheduling work units, but when it comes to managing the software environments that are the context of each of the planned computations, they are often remarkably shy to offer opinionated solutions.</p>

      <p>Software management and deployment often seems like an afterthought.  Workflow language designers increasingly seem to be following the devops trend of resorting to opaque application bundles to satisfy application and library needs.  While this strategy has some advantages it also comes with downsides that rarely seem to be weighed carefully.</p>

      <p>We present the Guix Workflow Language --- not as a solution to the question of software deployment in HPC workflows, but as an instance of convergent evolution: growing a workflow language out of a generic reproducible software management and deployment system (GNU Guix) instead of sprucing up a workflow language with software deployment features.  We hope to encourage a discussion about the current state of workflow languages in HPC: when it comes to software and distributed computations, are we approaching the peak or do we circle a local maximum?</p>

      <p>You can write unit- and integration tests in different ways, though sometimes you need to write higher level tests, such as <em>end-to-end</em> tests, which are often hard to write.</p>

      <p>By using frameworks like Spring Boot, there is already very good support within the framework to write tests and integration tests but if you have to deploy not on the Cloud (like DC/OS, K8S etc.), you might have issues to create an appropriate test environment. In particular, if you have several participants needed to get your application correctly running.</p>

      <p>So, based on JUnit Jupiter, Testcontainers, and some Java code, you can write real end-to-end Tests which are very helpful in several ways.</p>

      <p>It makes it more or less easy to create end-to-end Tests which can be run via your IDE also.</p>

      <p>There are several aspect which need to be taken care of, like how to synchronise the application and your test code, and so on.</p>

      <p>eLabFTW is an open source laboratory notebook for research labs. It tracks experiments and results but also features a database where you can keep track of all the elements in your lab. Created in 2012 and published on GitHub, eLabFTW quickly gained traction in the research community and several contributors joined over time to help implementing new features and fixing bugs. Now translated in 17 languages, eLabFTW has become a pillar of the ELN landscape and more and more labs and universities are using it all around the world.</p>

      <p>In this presentation I will talk about the software itself but also how publishing the source code on GitHub with a AGPLv3 license helped tremandously the software to grow.</p>

      <p>When doing research work, it is important to keep track of your experiments and results. To do that, we normally use paper lab notebooks. But nowadays, it makes little sense to stick to paper, especially when all of our results are produced in a numeric format. Users are now looking for a solution to that problem, and that solution is Electronic Laboratory Notebooks (ELN).</p>

      <p>Several ELN are available to researchers. Some are proprietary, and only a few are truly free (as in beer and as in speech). Among the libre ones, we can find quite a lot of abandoned projects.</p>

      <p>Since 2012, eLabFTW has seen continuous improvements with a constant flow of new features and a growing community of users, translators and contributors. It is now a mature and polished piece of software, widely used by startups, research labs and universities.</p>

      <p>Now backed by a company, the future seems bright and full of promises with fruitful collaborations with Universities to implement specific features that will benefit the whole community of users.</p>

      <p>Many emerging scientific workflows that target high-end HPC systems require a complex interplay with resource and job management software (RJMS). However, portable, efficient and easy-to-use scheduling of these workflows is still an unsolved problem. In this talk, we present Flux, a next-generation RJMS designed specifically to address the key scheduling challenges of modern workflows in a scalable, easy-to-use, and portable manner. At the heart of Flux lies its ability to be seamlessly nested within batch allocations created by itself as well as other system schedulers (e.g., SLURM, MOAB, LSF, etc), serving the target workflows as their “personal RJMS instances”. In particular, Flux’s consistent and rich set of well-defined APIs portably and efficiently support those workflows that can feature non-traditional patterns such as complex co-scheduling, massive ensembles of small jobs and coordination among jobs in an ensemble.</p>

      <p>We will also cover how the Flux-Framework project is structured around open-source development, including our use of the Collective Code Construction Contract (C4), RFCs, LGPL, and various online open-source platforms.  We discuss how these choices of open-source processes have influenced the repo structure, the code, our collaborations, and even the sub-teams within the project.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Expected prior knowledge / intended audience: Audience should have basic knowledge of batch job systems; knowledge of or experience with running scientific workflows is a plus. There will be some background on common workflows in the talk. This will be interesting to HPC users, workflow developers, and admins.</p>

      <p>Speaker bio: Stephen Herbein is a computer scientist in Livermore Computing at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  His research interests include batch job
      scheduling, parallel IO, and data analytics. He is a part of the Flux team, developing next-generation IO-aware and multi-level schedulers for HPC.</p>

      <p>Using baremetal and user level segregation, we can use systemd multi-instance to provide MariaDB as on demand PaaS, where every user gets their own configuration.</p>

      <p>This talk will show you what this looks like from a user and system maintainer perspective.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>With containers as all the rage, and the perceived default way of doing things, lets take a look at another approach of PaaS. Systemd as a service manager provides significant functionality on delivering multiple similar services in a managed way, so why not MariaDB PaaS?</p>

      <p>So with a few configuration changes from a default MariaDB install, let's show what a per user database instances looks like. Adding socket activation to mix and see "serverless" capability before it came fad with Kubernetes.</p>

      <p>On top of that, a brief look at abstract sockets that have been in MariaDB for while and what they could look like in a PaaS environment.</p>

      that make it NOT crash safe nor fault tolerant. In this talk the author would
      like to share his insights, findings and analysis about such issues and MySQL
      transaction processing in general, and how he and his team solved all these
      issues and made MySQL XA transaction processing really crash safe and fault
      tolerant, which is crucial to use MySQL as storage nodes of a distributed DBMS
      such as Kunlun.</p>"
    description: |-
      <p>In an era of data explosion, more and more database users will need distributed databases to scale out ever increasing data management needs. From the author's past decade of database kernel development experience in Oracle and Tencent, he knows that although MySQL is an excellent DBMS in itself, its storage capacity has a limit of a couple of terabytes. Beyond that, users would need table sharding to scale to multiple MySQL storage clusters to get good performance. And using MySQL as part of a distributed database will be more and more pervasive in the future, thus it's crucial that the MySQL XA  transaction processing issues be well understood and solved.</p>

      <p>In the author’s former work in Tencent TDSQL development team, he took the initiative to evolve TDSQL from a simple table sharding solution to a full-blown distributed DBMS which handles distributed transaction and query processing, among others, and TDSQL since then has been widely used inside Tencent and in Tencent’s public cloud service. In this work they solved a series of MySQL-5.7 XA transaction processing issues and pitfalls, so that TDSQL is made crash safe and fault tolerant. And they  reported such XA crash-safety bugs to MySQL official team and contributed the initial patches too.</p>

      <p>Since Aug 2019, the author  left Tencent and started to develop Kunlun distributed DBMS, which uses MySQL 8.0 as storage nodes. Based on his  previous experiences and knowledge of using MySQL-5.7 in TDSQL, he and his team implemented a series of features and functionality to make MySQL 8.0 XA transaction processing crash safe and fault tolerant. Note that community MySQL XA modules lack such guarantees.</p>

      <p>In order to connect to external databases, PostgreSQL supports Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW), and there are already many FDWs.
      However, among of FDWs have various restrictions preventing utilization of external databases features. As such a restriction,
      FDWs for schemaless databases need to change the foreign table definition, when some columns are added in remote database.
      This restriction can not take full advantage of the schemaless feature.
       In this time, we considered implementing FDW that does not require changing the external table when columns are added on
      external database. I would like to introduce this study based on the time-series database InfluxDB as schemaless database.</p>

      <p>When using PostgreSQL in production it is important to implement a strategy for High Availability. With a database service, the HA properties apply to both the service itself and of course to the data set.</p>

      <p>In this talk we learn how to think about specific HA needs of your production environment and how to achieve your requirements with Open Source tooling when it comes to your database of choice, PostgreSQL. In particular, we dive in many options that could be implemented for Postgres to evolve its offering from being a toolset to being “batteries included”. What does it mean in the context of HA? How to achieve it?</p>

      <p>Setting up multi-cluster and multi-cloud container networking for dev environments has been too harder than it needs to be.
      NoRouter is a novel instant networking stack to overcome this difficulty, by transferring IP packets over stdio streams (aka "shell connections").
      NoRouter works with any container, any VM, and any baremetal machine, on anywhere, as long as the shell connection is available from your laptop, e.g. <code>kubectl exec</code>, <code>docker exec</code>, or <code>ssh</code>.</p>

      <p>NoRouter heavily focuses on dev UX and does not need any setup other than deploying a single binary and writing a short YAML manifest.
      And yet it works even without the root privilege.</p>

      <p>'No-Code/Low-Code' software by Tiki.org has blurred the lines, allowing for team member participation and engagement on digital and data initiatives on many levels.  It goes well beyond many CRM, ERP, PM, etc, offerings which are good at what they do but typically narrow in focus, by giving users a wide mix of hundreds of tools in many categories - Front-end, Back-end, Databases, Admin and Mobile.  Big 'Features', supporting 'Features' and countless small but handy plugins all combine, allowing users to literally create any app for any business sector.  This less focused and 'utilitarian' nature is more relevant than ever as Tiki resolves a problem so many organizations today are struggling to solve - too many apps with little to no integration between them.  Tiki offers so much, in fact, that it allows individuals to become Full Stack Developers - this is my story  and where I'm at after using Tiki for over 8 years.  However, since it's FLOSS software it also fits developers like a glove, as unlike proprietary 'No-Code/Low-Code' offerings where even developers would need to submit Bug Reports and wait for responses, Tiki allows them to get  'under the hood' and debug complex configurations at their convenience.</p>

      <p>This presentation briefly covers a few 'No-Code/Low-Code' development tools in each of the 5 categories that Full Stack Developers need, various user roles and the levels on which they can participate as well as gives examples of 'No-Code' and 'Low-Code' within Tiki.</p>

      <p>Net neutrality is the principle that Internet Access Providers (IAPs) must treat all Internet communications equally, and not discriminate or charge differently based on user, content, website, platform, application and type of access equipment. The FSFE has been involved with net neutrality advocacy in Europe since 2013, achieving positive results in Germany with a law securing end-users the right of free choice of routers and modems.</p>

      <p>In the context of the reform of European telecommunications law, EU Member States must implement in their national jurisdiction the European Electronic Communications Code (Directive (EU) 2018/1972), which brings new rules on router freedom, allowing IAPs to limit the rights of users if they can determine an "objective technological necessity" for imposing their routers and modems on consumers.</p>

      <p>The talk will go through the historical developments in the last two years in Europe to  present an overview on the positions on the debate in regards to router freedom and the consequences for Free Software.</p>

      <p>As a take away, the talk will propose the discussion around the main principles of net neutrality and freedom of terminal equipment within the EU legal framework.</p>

      <p>SPARK is an open-source tool for formal verification of the Ada.
      language. Last year, support for pointers, aka access types, was
      added to SPARK. It works by enforcing an ownership
      policy somewhat similar to the one used in Rust. It ensures in
      particular that there is only one owner of a given data at all time,
      which can be used to modify it. One of the most complex parts for
      verification is the notion of borrowing. It allows to transfer the
      ownership of a part of a data-structure, but only for a limited time.
      Afterward ownership returns to the initial owner. In this talk, I will
      explain how this can be achieved and, in particular, how we can
      describe in the specification the relation between the borrower and
      the borrowed object at all times.</p>

      verification is the notion of borrowing. It allows to transfer the
      ownership of a part of a data-structure, but only for a limited time.
      Afterward ownership returns to the initial owner. In this talk, I will
      explain how this can be achieved and, in particular, how we can
      describe in the specification the relation between the borrower and
      the borrowed object at all times.</p>

      <p>Does open source need a W3C-inspired "priority of constituencies?"</p>

      <p>From its inception, open source—and free software before it—was built around ethical notions: give people agency and power over their software so they could use, modify, and share it as they pleased to accomplish whatever it is that they wanted to do with it.</p>

      <p>In a world where running software required programming skills, there was a lot of overlap between users and developers of open source, and so this rather simple framework was sufficient to deal with open source’s different constituencies.</p>

      <p>Since then, open source has become ubiquitous. As a result, the number of constituencies has ballooned: there are indie and corporate contributors and maintainers, open source software vendors, developers building proprietary code on top of open source, end-users who don’t know anything about software, people impacted by open source software who are not even using it, cloud providers, etc., etc.</p>

      <p>When the interests of these different actors are in conflict, which one of them do we favor and why? Neither the Four Freedoms nor the Open Source Definition (OSD) really helps us answer that question.</p>

      <p>We’ll then see how we could apply the priority of constituencies to open source, what that reveals about the complexity of the open source ecosystem, and in particular how the parts that are difficult to fit in such a framework are precisely those that have made the news in the past few years.</p>

      <p>Many open-source libraries provide an interface for the Twitter API. However, most people use these tools in temporary scripts for a one-time tweets collection. Moving to a robust application for collecting and indexing tweets over long periods of time requires some programming knowledge that most social science researchers do not master. In order to meet this need, the medialab has developed gazouilloire, a tool that makes it possible to easily configure the collection parameters (keywords searched, language of tweets, location of tweets, etc.) and can then be launched from the command line.</p>

      <p>Gazouilloire combines two methods to collect tweets from the Twitter API ("search" and "filter") in order to maximize the number of collected tweets, and automatically fills the gaps in the collection in case of connexion errors or reboots. It also provides a large range of features that are not directly available from the free Twitter API: collecting during specific periods of time, resolving redirected urls, downloading only certain types of media contents (only photos and no videos, for example) or unfolding Twitter conversations. The user can then choose to export the tweets in csv format, and select the fields that will form the columns of the table.</p>

      <p>Social science researchers have already used gazouilloire for a wide variety of studies: measuring online activity during COVID-19 lockdown, studying the public discourse of anti-vaxxers, or monitoring urban nature policies, among many others...</p>

      <p>Buildtest (https://buildtest.readthedocs.io/) is an HPC testing framework to aid HPC facilities to perform acceptance testing for their system. HPC systems are growing in complexity, with a tightly coupled software and system stack that requires a degree of automation and continuous testing. In the past decade, two build frameworks (Spack, EasyBuild) have emerged and widely used in HPC community for automating build &amp; installation process for scientific software. On the contrary, testing frameworks for HPC systems are limited to a few handful (ReFrame, Pavilion2, buildtest) that are in active development.</p>

      <p>In buildtest, users will write test recipes in YAML called buildspecs that buildtest process to generate a shell script. buildtest utilizes versioned-based JSON Schema for validating buildspecs and currently, we support two main schemas (compiler, script). The script schema and compiler schema are used for writing traditional shell-scripts (bash, sh, csh), python-scripts and single source compilation test. In this talk we will present an overview of buildtest and how one can write buildspecs. Furthermore, we will discuss Cori Testsuite (https://github.com/buildtesters/buildtest-cori) in buildtest with several real examples on testing various components for Cori system at NERSC.</p>

The workflow is based on the event queue polling model, the opposite of event push, that allows Serverless computing frameworks, such as KEDA, to preemptively scale the functions based on the queue length. Such workflow is more advantageous  and lightweighted in dealing with highly bursty event traffic and reducing Serverless function cold start overhead.</p>

      <p>I discuss the challenges of teaching Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Software-Defined Radio (SDR) concepts to those without any background in the area.  At the University of Maryland I created an elective for undergraduates in the CS dept. that introduced DSP and SDR in a hands-on manner, and have since taught the course twice.  During this course, students learn basic wireless communications and DSP concepts, and how to implement the techniques onto SDRs.  Additional course learning objectives include digital signals, filtering, frequency domain, digital modulation, noisey channels, cellular, and IoT.  The course utilizes open-source SDR toolkit software including GNU Radio and Python libraries, allowing students more interesting and engaging assignments/exercises and more advanced concepts to be explored.  Every student had a PlutoSDR to use during the semester.  What is unique about this course is that this material is typically taught at the graduate level within ECE, spread across numerous individual courses.  CS students, at least at our university, do not get exposed to any DSP or signals background which is normally required to learn about SDR using traditional methods/textbooks, so they must start from scratch, which is why this course has heavy use of graphics, animations, and examples.  As such, this course does not dive as deep into the mathematics behind the theory as a normal graduate level ECE course would.  There is much more emphasis on "learning by doing", and actually creating SDR applications.</p>

      <p>In addition to the course I have created a free online textbook called PySDR, that is based on the material I taught in my course, which anyone can use to learn DSP and SDR using Python.  My textbook does not use any custom libraries or code, it's essentially showing how to use straight Python (e.g. mostly numpy, scipy, and matplotlib) to actually do DSP and create SDR applications.  Through feedback I've gotten from people using this online textbook, I have learned about what it takes to teach DSP and SDR to folks in a non-university setting. The source code used to generate the textbook (using Sphinx) is hosted on GitHub, so that readers can submit issues or even PRs, to date there has been several contributors.  I'm hoping this presentation can show that you don't need to be a EE with a masters degree to dive into DSP and SDR.</p>

      <p>Security Protocol and Data Model (SPDM) is a standard published by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) organization Platform Management Components Intercommunication (PMCI) working group. SPDM’s vision is to resolve the long-lasting problem of compatible secure communication solution between two endpoints of embedded systems. Protocols defined by SPDM can be used for a wide range of security functionalities including authentication of hardware/firmware identities, delivering measurements, performing attestation, and establishing session keys for secure communication channels.</p>

      <p>This presentation introduces OpenSPDM, an open-source sample implementation which implements an SPDM requester utility to validate a vendor’s responder implementation. The talk covers SPDM 1.0 device authentication and firmware measurement collection, and SPDM 1.1 session creation for data communication protection.</p>

      <p>The audience will learn the main components of the SPDM protocol. A firmware solution builder will learn how to implement a SPDM requester to perform device authentication/attestation and create a secured session with a target device. A device builder will learn how to implement a SPDM responder for authentication/measurement requests and create a secured session to protect communications.</p>

      <p>The connected car has been around some time but we are still waiting for a large breakthrough when it comes to third party services powered by vehicle data. The fragmentation of different technical solutions makes it difficult for 3rd parties or developers to work with easily accessible vehicle APIs.</p>

      <p>To tackle this, the GENIVI Cloud &amp; Connected Services project is designing an end-to-end communication framework starting from the data transfer from embedded systems in the vehicles and spanning to cloud based APIs. The framework is built on open protocols and is demonstrated with open-source reference code with the aim of simplifying implementation work for both car manufacturers and 3rd party developers. This presentation will detail the work results to date and will be co-presented by Kevin Valdek from HIGH MOBILITY and Ulf Bjorkengren from Geotab.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>We’ll have a look at the key technical challenges and considerations that are necessary to make in order to create a successful framework. Designing a useful API for developers starts in the vehicle where topics like the data model is already considered. Further on, we’ll show a Proof-of-Concept implementation that anyone can try out.</p>

      <p>The Proof-of-Concept implements a data server in the vehicle that exposes an API to data clients, such as backend servers. The data transfer interface follows the W3C Vehicle API protocol and the Proof-of-Concept brings in additional considerations in the cloud to make APIs available to 3rd party developers.</p>

      <p>The GENIVI Alliance is a non-profit automotive industry alliance that develops standard approaches for integrating operating systems and middleware present in the centralized and connected vehicle cockpit. The Cloud &amp; Connected Services project is performed by a work group that is open for anyone to join and to contribute to.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we first show how to prototype high-speed network functions with FastClick, an open-source packet processing framework, which comes with hundreds of pre-built building blocks and leverages DPDK or Netmap to build 100-Gbps-capable firewalls, load-balancers, NATs, or IDSes.</p>

      <p>We then review the history of high-speed software dataplanes. We explain the evolution of graph-based (software) network packet processing from the early 2000s with the emergence of the Click Modular Router, and continue up to today's ecosystem, where many similar systems, such as VPP, BESS, and FastClick, coexist. We analyze the upcoming challenges to process packets at multi-hundred-gigabit-per-second rates. We argue that multi-hundred-gigabit networks should prevent performing memory accesses, as the interarrival time of packets is shrinking to a few nanoseconds, i.e., smaller than L3 cache access time. For instance, a 100-Gbps NIC could receive a minimal-sized frame every 6.72ns while operating at its maximum rate.</p>

      <p>To address these challenges, we propose PacketMill, our latest work, where we discuss other efforts/optimizations required to improve the performance of packet processing. PacketMill's ideas are directly applied to FastClick, so it comes for free. More specifically, we develop/use a better integration of DPDK to minimize the memory footprint of the high-speed software dataplanes. Furthermore, we propose a pipeline to reduce the number of instructions required for processing packets by using new data structures directly derived from the graph of network functions and compiler optimization techniques.</p>

      presented last year on the Open Source Firmware, BMC and Bootloader devroom.
      The talk will cover the news around the AMD support in Open Source Firmware
      ecosystem from the past year. You will hear, among others, about: FSF RYF KGPE-D16
      platform revival, AMD Ryzen R1000/V1000 series AGESA integration into open source
      TianoCore EDK2, TrenchBoot new features and updates and current support of AMD
      Picasso and Cezanne SoCs in coreboot, pure open-source on AMD Rome platform
      in oreboot.</p>'
    description: "<p>The history of AMD cooperation in coreboot projects reaches 2007
      where the first contribution appeared for the Geode LX processors. AMD's open-source
      support continued for many years until now (with some break). This presentation
      will briefly introduce the history of AMD and coreboot, the evolution of the
      code, processors, creation of CIMX and AGESA and so on. It will also show the
      gradual change in the AMD attitude to open-source and introduction of binary
      platform initialization. Binary blobs, very disliked by the open-source community
      started to cause problems and raised the needs for workarounds to support basic
      processor features. Soon after that AMD stopped supporting the coreboot community.
      Moreover, recent coreboot releases started to enforce certain requirements on
      the features supported by the silicon code base. Aging platforms kept losing
      interest and many of them (including fully open ones) are being dropped from

    raw_abstract: '<p>This is the continuation of the "Status of AMD platform in coreboot"
      presented last year on the Open Source Firmware, BMC and Bootloader devroom.
      The talk will cover the news around the AMD support in Open Source Firmware
      ecosystem from the past year. You will hear, among others, about: FSF RYF KGPE-D16
      platform revival, AMD Ryzen R1000/V1000 series AGESA integration into open source
      TianoCore EDK2, TrenchBoot new features and updates and current support of AMD

    raw_description: "<p>The history of AMD cooperation in coreboot projects reaches
      2007 where the first contribution appeared for the Geode LX processors. AMD's
      open-source support continued for many years until now (with some break). This
      presentation will briefly introduce the history of AMD and coreboot, the evolution
      of the code, processors, creation of CIMX and AGESA and so on. It will also
      show the gradual change in the AMD attitude to open-source and introduction
      of binary platform initialization. Binary blobs, very disliked by the open-source
      community started to cause problems and raised the needs for workarounds to
      support basic processor features. Soon after that AMD stopped supporting the
      coreboot community. Moreover, recent coreboot releases started to enforce certain
      requirements on the features supported by the silicon code base. Aging platforms
      kept losing interest and many of them (including fully open ones) are being
      dropped from the main tree. Nowadays AMD released the newest AGESA with the
      cooperation of hired coreboot developers, but only for Google and their Chromebooks
      based on Ryzen processors. 3mdeb trying hard with this ecosystem showing that
      the AGESA can be integrated into Open Source Firmware like TianoCore EDK2 on

      <p>The IBM POWERPC architecture exists since early 90. Many may also know that the POWER processors were used in Apple Macintosh between 1994-2006. Today the IBM goes forward with their POWER processors releasing newer and newer processor
      families like POWER9 and even POWER10 recently. Modern POWER architecture features very high computing performance with multi-core processors which makes them ideal for servers and computing clusters. They also are great as a workstation, for example Raptor Computing Systems Talos II (POWER9), which is the reference platform used during the coreboot port. A huge advantage of OpenPOWER architecture is its openness. Compared to modern x86 architecture which is full of binary blobs, POWER can easily rival with x86 domination and dethrone it from the most common used processors architecture in modern computers. Although the OpenPOWER firmware and documentation is open-source the development of coreboot for POWER9 is very challenging and full of unknowns. In this presentation you will hear about the current progress of the work on coreboot POWER9 support, what problems we face and how much effort it takes to enable new  architecture in coreboot.</p>

      <p>Cloud-based HPC can address both challenges: The cloud offers as much compute time as desired, plus the possibility to efficiently scale individual simulations over multiple instances connected by a high-performance interconnect. We build a cloud-based HPC cluster in a straightforward and reproducible way by simplifying software management with SPACK and cluster lifecycle management with AWS ParallelCluster. With the SPACK package manager, diverse hardware is easily incorporated into a single cluster, e.g. instances with AMD, ARM, and Intel processors, instances with (multiple) GPUs and instances with high-performance interconnect.</p>

      <p>On the cluster, we used several representative biomolecular systems to benchmark the GROMACS performance on a various hardware available in the cloud, both on individual instances as well as across multiple instances. This way we uncover which instances deliver the highest performance or the best performance-to-price ratio for GROMACS simulations.</p>

      <p>As a next step, we are preparing to run a large ensemble consisting of 20,000 individual simulations in the cloud using all resources that are globally available to reduce the time to solution as much as possible.

      <p>The World Wide Web’s original design as a vast open documentary space built around the concept of hypertext made it a fantastic research field to study networks of actors of a specific field or controversy and analyse their connectivity. <a href="https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/outils/navicrawler/"><em>Navicrawler</em></a>, <a href="https://www.issuecrawler.net/"><em>IssueCrawler</em></a>, <a href="https://hyphe.medialab.sciences-po.fr/"><em>Hyphe</em></a>... Over the past 15 years, a variety of web crawling tools, most often free and open source, have been developped by or for social sciences research labs across the world. They provide means to engage with the web as a research field or to teach students what the WWW is beyond Google or Facebook’s interfaces.</p>

      <p>We will first present an overview of this history of open source web crawling tools built for research, teaching or data journalism purposes. Then we will propose a short demonstration of the latest version of médialab's <em>HyBro</em>, aka <em>Hyphe-Browser</em>, a tool built to let users benefit from automated web crawling as well as <em>in situ</em> web browsing and categorizing. Its friendly user interface allows a variety of publics to engage with web crawling, including non-experts like students, social science scholars, and activists.</p>

      <p>The World Wide Web’s original design as a vast open documentary space built around the concept of hypertext made it a fantastic research field to study networks of actors of a specific field or controversy and analyse their connectivity. <a href="https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/outils/navicrawler/"><em>Navicrawler</em></a>, <a href="https://www.issuecrawler.net/"><em>IssueCrawler</em></a>, <a href="https://hyphe.medialab.sciences-po.fr/"><em>Hyphe</em></a>... Over the past 15 years, a variety of web crawling tools, most often free and open source, have been developped by or for social sciences research labs across the world. They provide means to engage with the web as a research field or to teach students what the WWW is beyond Google or Facebook’s interfaces.</p>

      <p>We will first present an overview of this history of open source web crawling tools built for research, teaching or data journalism purposes. Then we will propose a short demonstration of the latest version of médialab's <em>HyBro</em>, aka <em>Hyphe-Browser</em>, a tool built to let users benefit from automated web crawling as well as <em>in situ</em> web browsing and categorizing. Its friendly user interface allows a variety of publics to engage with web crawling, including non-experts like students, social science scholars, and activists.</p>

      <p>gr-satellites is a GNU Radio OOT module that contains a collection of telemetry decoders for Amateur satellites. At FOSDEM20 we presented an on-going large refactor to improve modularity and usabilty. The new version was finally released in June and includes a command line tool to run the decoders, GNU Radio blocks of both high and low level to allow customized designs, and comprehensive user documentation. Moreover, gr-satellites now has cross-platform support through Conda, has been included in Debian and has an Ubuntu PPA.</p>

      <p>In 2017, the FSFE started the REUSE initiative. The main goal is to make it easier for developers to declare the licensing and copyright situation for their code. Especially in common scenarios where a repository contains code from various sources under different licenses with multiple copyright holders, it often becomes complex for everyone who wants to legally reuse code.</p>

      <p>Therefore, REUSE provides best practices that aim to be compatible with already existing recommendations and still cover also complex projects and their edge cases. The result is that for a REUSE compatible repository, every single file in some way carries information about its license and copyright holder(s), with the full license text(s) available.</p>

      <p>To make adoption as easy as possible, REUSE offers tools and accompanying documentation. Thanks to this, we already see hundreds of projects being REUSE compliant already. The more projects follow the best practices, the easier developers can reuse their code safely and thereby contribute to a system in which you do not need a lawyer to license your code.</p>

    description: |-
      <p>Seccomp is a feature of the Linux kernel that allows to filter the system calls that a process is allowed to execute. This is commonly used by containers as a way to improve the isolation between the container and the host. Both container runtime runc and Kubernetes allow users to define a Seccomp policy via the OCI Runtime Specification and the PodSpec respectively.</p>

      <p>Seccomp recently grew a new feature called the Seccomp Notify in Linux 5.0 and improved in Linux 5.9. This allows a seccomp policy not only to take an immediate decision on whether to allow or deny a system call, but also to defer the control to an external process that I called the Seccomp Agent. The Seccomp agent can decide to block the system call, let it continue, or, up to some extent, execute the system call on behalf of the container. This allows new use cases like running privileged workloads in a safer way and some unprivileged container builds setups.</p>

      <p>In this talk, I will present the Seccomp Notify feature and the architecture in runc that makes use of it. I will describe the current status of this feature in Kubernetes. I will demonstrate a couple of use cases in Kubernetes and show how easy it is to build your own seccomp agent in Golang to support new use cases. The audience can expect mentions of pidfd_getfd, the addfd ioctl, and more.</p>

    abstract: <p>The Internet originally thrived on interoperable services - until
      the "walled gardens" came. The European Commission recently proposed new regulations
      (DSA/DMA/DGA) to protect democracy and restore openness and competition. The
      talk will introduce them and their economic and political background; it will
      then focus on a specific point, the requirement for dominant platforms to interoperate
      with third parties, though only in limited cases, using messaging and social
      media as example.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>A few decades ago, the Internet was open, interoperable and based on federated services that allowed everyone to cooperate and deploy new content and services: email is the classic example. Then, consolidation happened: the talk will show a common European perspective of how we ended up with a concentration of money and power of unseen scale in the history of mankind, which perpetuates itself by adopting the "walled garden" service model. The best example of this model is instant messaging, where people have a hard time switching to different service providers as they need to be on a specific app to communicate with all the other users of the same app. This creates dominant positions that are often used to impose unfavourable terms and conditions onto users.</p>

      <p>In the European political and regulatory scene, this has been increasingly perceived as a problem under many dimensions: tax revenue, privacy, national security, law enforcement, free speech, and even democracy. All these dimensions boiled down into a call for "digital sovereignty", meaning more autonomy and stronger reliance on EU-provided services that keep the wealth they produce local, but also more control and stronger capabilities to set and enforce European rules for the Internet in Europe, without having to negotiate them with the big American platforms.</p>

      <p>Open source has been identified as a fitting software development model for Europe and increasingly supported. Open source development matches the "cooperation in diversity" that is required by the multinational, multicultural nature of the European Union, and naturally offers remedies to consolidation.</p>

      <p>After quickly introducing the three regulatory proposals - the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act and the Data Governance Act - the final part of the talk will focus on the DMA and on a specific topic: interoperability provisions. "Walled garden" instant messaging apps could be turned into open, federated email-style services by forcing dominant providers to open up and interoperate with potential competitors, so that users of one app could exchange messages with the users of all the other apps.</p>

      <p>The current DMA proposal by the European Commission, however, only does this in part. The interoperability clause in Article 6.1(f) only covers ancillary services such as payments, advertising or identification, but not core services like messaging and social media; and only for business users. The "real time" data portability clause in Article 6.1(h) would not allow true interoperability and would still require users to hold an account on each service and accept its unilateral contractual terms.</p>

      <p>The talk builds on the efforts of a coalition of open source software companies and digital rights NGOs that have been campaigning for full interoperability clauses in the DMA. It also builds on a technical policy paper that discusses the topic and that was submitted to the Commission during last summer's consultation. We hope to open up the debate, validate our ideas and build community discussion around this issue.</p>

    abstract: "<p>2020 was a very bad year for most of us, under the shadow of all
      that was going on there was a troubling trend we all need to be aware of: the
      erosion of the classic open source model and values.   For years vendors have
      been slowly chipping away at the freedom and openness provided by open source,
      this year saw unprecedented changes to how people view and value OSS.   From
      licensing changes to as a service exclusive, what was open is no longer.  Is
      this being driven solely by the cloud?  or is this purely corporate greed and
      others viewing open Source as a successful business model to replicate?   Let's
      not only discuss but bring to light the trouble trends that threaten open source
      projects and development as we know it.</p>"

      <p>"[W]e didn't open source it to get help from the community, to make the product better. We open sourced as a freemium strategy; to drive adoption." - MongoDB CEO Dev Ittycheria</p>

      <p>Open source was never designed or planned to be used as "Gateway Drug" to move people to a proprietary locked in software, but more and more this is happening.   This is not just a MongoDB move; Elastic, Redis, and others have all used the "Cloud" as a convenient excuse to erode classic open source licenses and values.   At the same time new "open source compatible" versions of popular projects like MySQL or PostgreSQL pop up on cloud providers platforms.  It's like the game "Among Us" only with your open source projects.  You never know who or what is really open until you dig deep.</p>

    raw_abstract: "<p>2020 was a very bad year for most of us, under the shadow of
      all that was going on there was a troubling trend we all need to be aware of:
      the erosion of the classic open source model and values.   For years vendors
      have been slowly chipping away at the freedom and openness provided by open
      source, this year saw unprecedented changes to how people view and value OSS.
      \  From licensing changes to as a service exclusive, what was open is no longer.
      \ Is this being driven solely by the cloud?  or is this purely corporate greed
      and others viewing open Source as a successful business model to replicate?
      \  Let's not only discuss but bring to light the trouble trends that threaten
      open source projects and development as we know it.</p>"

      <p>"[W]e didn't open source it to get help from the community, to make the product better. We open sourced as a freemium strategy; to drive adoption." - MongoDB CEO Dev Ittycheria</p>

      <p>Open source was never designed or planned to be used as "Gateway Drug" to move people to a proprietary locked in software, but more and more this is happening.   This is not just a MongoDB move; Elastic, Redis, and others have all used the "Cloud" as a convenient excuse to erode classic open source licenses and values.   At the same time new "open source compatible" versions of popular projects like MySQL or PostgreSQL pop up on cloud providers platforms.  It's like the game "Among Us" only with your open source projects.  You never know who or what is really open until you dig deep.</p>

      <p>When the initial release of Qt was published in 1995, it was one of the first projects to use a dual-licensing model. This model, LGPL and a proprietary commercial license today, has served the project well for more than 25 years. It is less well known that the dual-licensing model is supported by a community contract which guarantees the freedom of Qt beyond what is in the license covered. This contract is maintained by the KDE Free Qt Foundation and has kept Qt free through multiple acquisitions and other turbulences.</p>

      <p>This presentation will explain the community contract, how it augments the dual-licensing model, and how it has evolved and served its purpose for 25 years and counting. It will also discuss what are the lessons learned and how it can serve as a model for projects today.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The KDE Free Qt Foundation was born from a heated dispute about open source licenses in the late nineties. It resulted in a unique mechanism to ensure software freedom for the Qt and KDE ecosystems through a contract between the community and the company owning the project. It has stood the test of time and got the community a seat at the negotiation table going through multiple acqisitions.</p>

      <p>The contract between the KDE Free Qt Foundation and what is today The Qt Company gives the community a say in any license changes to Qt. It guarantees that there is the base for a sustainable model to provide Qt under an open source license and a corresponding open source based business model. With this it goes beyond what licenses cover. It is the counterpart to CLAs as it's constructed asymmetrically in favor of the community. That it has preserved the freedom of Qt through multiple acquisitions, among them Nokia buying and selling the technology, is a testament for the effectiveness of this setup.</p>

      <p>The presentation is based on a series of conversations with the people involved and first-hand experience from serving as a representative of the KDE Free Qt Foundation.</p>

      <p>The presentation is based on a series of conversations with the people involved and first-hand experience from serving as a representative of the KDE Free Qt Foundation.</p>

      <p>Sure, lots of tech came from the US; Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon but a large proportion of the story of free and open source software didn't happen in the US. In fact, most of the exciting parts of the work to encourage people to adopt, build and adapt open source are happening in other places. In this conversation, Deb Nicholson and Hong Phuc Dang will look at the global state of open source policy and talk about why no particular country -- especially the US -- should be centered. They'll cover:</p>

      <pre><code>* Public code strategies and adoption of open source tools in different jurisdictions
      * Policy initiatives that foster free and open source software production
      * Local FOSS adoption blueprints that could be replicated around the world
      </code></pre>

      <p>Open source is a global community of tinkerers, collaborators and innovators. It's time to share the spotlight more equitably. Solutions for small cities, or minority language groups or vulnerable populations could come from anywhere and be applied around the world. The discussions around public code and adoption aren't even happening in the US yet, and code without hearty adoption isn't enough. So, let's make sure the conversation about the future of open source is a truly global one!</p>

      <p>Coriolis is a suite of software for taking chip designs and turning them into ASICs (aka VLSI design).  It is silicon-proven, having been used with Alliance auto-scaleable nsxlib Cell Libraries to produce ("tape out") NDA-free GDS-II files that resulted in successful working 180nm ASICs, and has been used in ASICs up to 800k gates.  The input is HDL (verilog, VHDL, and yosys RTLIL) and the output is 100% complete GDS-II, with IO pads, cells, SRAMs all fully "Placed and Routed", ready for ASIC manufacture.</p>

      <p>However unlike traditional P&amp;R software (which may or may not have had, at some point in its development, a scripting language added as an afterthought), coriolis2 is written in a hybrid of c++ and python modules.  Layout is done not by a file format that must be loaded by a GUI: layout for each ASIC is actually a python program that, through the coriolis2 python modules imported by that program, reads the HDL, reads the Cell Libraries, and, fully under parametric programmatic control, creates the layout.</p>

      <p>This talk explains how that works, and illustrates using examples including the Chips4Makers Libre Cell Library and the LibreSOC Project.  LibreSOC is 130k gates which is 2.5 times larger than previous auto-routed coriolis ASICs, presenting new challenges.</p>

      <p>Kubernetes is becoming the platform of choice for more and more application developers. As applications become more complex and more distributed, they may span multiple Kubernetes clusters, or a combination of Kubernetes and on-premise workloads. While internal traffic within a Kubernetes cluster is handled by the CNI plugin, the external traffic between these workloads, or from workloads to end users, is often carried over a Software Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN), which is used for traffic optimization. The <a href="https://github.com/CloudNativeSDWAN"><strong>Cloud Native SD-WAN (CN-WAN) open source project</strong></a> was created to help SD-WAN deployments to identify Kubernetes applications and optimize traffic based on application requirements, thereby bridging together the <em>DevOps</em> from Kubernetes' cloud native world with the <em>NetOps</em> from the SD-WAN world.</p>

      <p>CN-WAN enables developers to <strong>annotate their applications</strong>, specifying the type of network traffic generated by the Kubernetes workload, and this information is then published into a service registry. The NetOps configuring the SD-WAN can take these annotations and develop network optimization policies with the clear knowlegde of the traffic type they intend to optimize.</p>

      <p>Join us for this presentation, where we will describe the components of the solution, the interfaces between the components, and how you can adapt this solution to different SD-WAN products and service registries.</p>

      <p>Signal processing of Sentinel1 spaceborne RADAR datasets freely available from the European Space Agency web site, followed by the deployment of a corner reflector which will be visible in the latest datasets.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Software Defined Radio users and developers are well aware of the {I, Q} stream and their handling for powerful software processing at baseband. While most developments focus on hardware, acquisition and digital communication signal decoding, a huge dataset of {I, Q} samples is available from the spaceborne Sentinel1 satellites. Indeed, the European Space Agency is providing free access (the anonymous registration with the service will be discussed in the presentation) to the datasets collected by the two Sentinel-1{A, B} satellites. Spaceborne RADAR provide all-weather (RADAR is not affected by cloud), day-night (RADAR is active and does not depend on external illumination sources) monitoring conditions covering the whole surface of the Earth from the low Earth polar orbiting satellites. Most significant over optical measurements, microwave RADAR measurements allow for phase recovery and hence interferometric measurement which is not possible with optical measurements. Furthermore, radiofrequence wave complex interactions with the reflective surfaces (scattering, absorption, polarization rotation) provides a rich context for analysis complementary to optical observations.</p>

      <p>Thanks to the Single Look Complex, Interferometric Wide datasets collected over land, discovering Interferometric Synthetic Aperture RADAR processing is no longer a matter of being associated with a dedicated laboratory and applying to selective research projects (e.g. Canadian RADAR-Sat datasets or German TanDEM-X) but only of fetching the huge datasets (4-GB/image) and learning the processing sequence.</p>

      <p>In this talk which will appear as a sequel to the development of Ground Based SDR RADAR discussed during GRCon2020 [1], we will introduce a processing flowchart first relying on the SNAP graphical user interface provided by ESA before switching to an automated command line approach relying on
      Makefile since each processing step depends on the proper completion of the previous one. We will address some basic conditions whose results are expected, namely German open-pit coal mines and earthquake-induced land motion. Indeed the 5 mx20 m pixel and 5.6 cm wavelength is best suited for large scale, sub-cm natural or human-induced geomorphological transformations, while the short term coherence is best achieved by analyzing the successive data collected from one observation to another with a 12-day repetition rate.</p>

      <p>After demonstrating a functional flowchart resulting in GeoTIFF phase and coherence maps consistent with optical satellite and aerial imagery, we conclude the presentation by adding a cooperative target corner reflector acting as localized point-like measurement source, assuming the reflector is large enough to be the dominant reflection source over the pixel area.</p>

We will address some basic conditions whose results are expected, namely German open-pit coal mines and earthquake-induced land motion. Indeed the 5 mx20 m pixel and 5.6 cm wavelength is best suited for large scale, sub-cm natural or human-induced geomorphological transformations, while the short term coherence is best achieved by analyzing the successive data collected from one observation to another with a 12-day repetition rate.</p>

      <p>After demonstrating a functional flowchart resulting in GeoTIFF phase and coherence maps consistent with optical satellite and aerial imagery, we conclude the presentation by adding a cooperative target corner reflector acting as localized point-like measurement source, assuming the reflector is large enough to be the dominant reflection source over the pixel area.</p>

      <p>Embedded systems are tailored to a specific task aimed at minimizing resource and energy consumption (e.g. ADi PlutoSDR). Cross-compiling benefits from powerful personal computer computational resources and user-friendly interfaces while removing the burden on the embedded board of running the compiler. GNU Radio was ported to Buildroot to provide SDR enthusiasts access to the many boards supported by this cross-compilation framework. We demonstrate its use in a graduate course project aimed at developing an embedded network analyzer.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>A network analyzer for characterizing a radiofrequency device requires a radiofrequency receiver for collecting the signal that was generated to probe the response of a Device Under Test, and a matching signal source. We consider the RTL-SDR dongle as the receiver, while the Raspberry Pi processor Phase Locked Loop (PLL) has been shown to generate a radiofrequency signal in the FM band. In this demonstration, PiFM is used as a signal source.
      As students were not allowed to visit university during lockdown, a cost-effective solution had to be found to provide hardware to all students to complete the course at home: the solution of a Raspberry Pi4 and DVB-T dongle was selected to provide the framework of embedded radiofrequency system development. GNU Radio is cross-compiled using Buildroot to the Raspberry Pi 4, iterative tests allow for checking the functionality of each step, until a complete measurement is achieved.</p>

      <p>The Law Factory is a research project which attempts to make it easier to observe the law-making process in the French Parliament. It allows to track down the different steps of the parliament process, to identify when a particular piece of law was introduced, and to look at all the amendments and the debates per article. The software is fully open-source, based on Python 3 for the data collection. It's a common project of the association Regards Citoyens, the médialab research lab of Sciences Po Paris and the Centre d’Études Européennes et de Politique Comparée.</p>

      <p>Keeping work organized in experimental materials science research is a nightmare. Projects involve data collected with dozens of different instruments on dozens of different samples that are related to eachother in a hierarchical fashion. For each new project, researchers struggle with questions like: how should I organize my files and data? How should I name my samples? How should I keep track of the links between data and samples? Since no standard answer to these questions has been formulated, labs and individuals just improvise. The result is that most data and samples become utterly useless once the person who conducted the research leaves; no one else can find their way through the ad-hoc naming conventions and various excel sheets. This eventually translates into a lot of wasted and repeated efforts.</p>

      <p>The biological sciences have long ago figured out solutions to these problems, and they are lab information systems (LIMS) and digital lab notebooks. In this talk I will present how I organize my research workflow in eLabFTW, a free and open source lab notebook with some LIMS capabilities. The tool was originally developed with molecular biologists in mind, but most of the tooling is useful for materials scientists. I will also talk about how I could leverage the python API for tailoring the tool to my needs, for example for printing QR-code stickers for database items.</p>

      <p>OpenNebula has recently incorporated a new supported hypervisor: Firecracker. This next generation virtualization technology was launched by AWS in late 2018 and is designed for secure multi-tenant container-based services. This integration provides an innovative solution to the classic dilemma between using containers—lighter but with weaker security—or Virtual Machines—with strong security but high overhead.</p>

      <p>Firecracker is an open source technology that makes use of KVM to launch lightweight Virtual Machines—called micro-VMs—for enhanced security, workload isolation, and resource efficiency. It is widely used by AWS as part of their Fargate and Lambda services. Firecracker opens up a whole new world of possibilities as the foundation for serverless offerings that need to deploy containerized critical applications nearly instantly while keeping them in isolation.</p>

      <p>OpenNebula is a simple, yet robust, open source platform for building Enterprise Clouds and managing Data Center virtualization. Its integration with public cloud providers offers additional flexibility in creating True Hybrid and Edge infrastructures. By incorporating Firecracker, OpenNebula now provides users with a powerful solution for serverless computing and an alternative, native model for secure container orchestration.</p>

      <p>In this talk we will explain the technical details of this integration and will show a live demo on how to easily deploy and orchestrate a composition of Docker Hub images running as Firecracker microVMs on a distributed bare-metal Edge infrastructure.</p>

      <p>The lack of accessible quality healthcare is one of the biggest problems in Africa and other developing countries. This is not only due to the unavailability of resources, but also to the absence of a structured formative process for the design and management of healthcare facilities. This situation   strongly contributes to deepening inequalities in access to quality healthcare.
      Through an Open Society Foundations funded project, the Mboalab aims to remedy these inequalities by building Open-Source devices for medical labs. Local manufacturing can address the infrastructural barriers that prevent imported or donated equipment from being properly used, and can facilitate the diffusion of innovation into healthcare practice. This project is part of the large MboaLab mission to contribute to the Common good and catalyze sustainable local development through Open Science.</p>

      it comes to networking. Think big data, storage, analytics, 5G, virtual network
      functions, then encrypt it all at 40Gbps line rates. Kubernetes and the Kubernetes
      network model are increasingly seen as essential to help manage these workloads
      at scale. But the cost of containerization and container networking can be hard
      to swallow for workloads that are often used to having dedicated NICs and physical
      hardware. Our novel solution was to cook up a feast that is a fusion of two
      worlds: combining Calico, the popular cloud native Kubernetes network plugin,
      with VPP, a very fast and scalable userspace packet processing software. In
      this talk we will lift the lid on what we’ve been cooking and the key ingredients
      that made it possible to offer an all you can eat buffet for your hungriest

    raw_abstract: "<p>There are classes of workloads that are notoriously hungry when
      it comes to networking. Think big data, storage, analytics, 5G, virtual network
      functions, then encrypt it all at 40Gbps line rates. Kubernetes and the Kubernetes
      network model are increasingly seen as essential to help manage these workloads
      at scale. But the cost of containerization and container networking can be hard
      to swallow for workloads that are often used to having dedicated NICs and physical
      hardware. Our novel solution was to cook up a feast that is a fusion of two
      worlds: combining Calico, the popular cloud native Kubernetes network plugin,
      with VPP, a very fast and scalable userspace packet processing software. In
      this talk we will lift the lid on what we’ve been cooking and the key ingredients
      that made it possible to offer an all you can eat buffet for your hungriest
      workloads.</p>"

      <p>PANDORÆ : Retrieving, curating and exploring enhanced corpi through time and space
      Mapping the state of research in a particular field has been made easier through commercial services providing API-based bibliometric-enhanced corpuses retrieval. Common assertions such as “the use of CRISPR technologies has skyrocketed in laboratories all around the world since 2012” can now be easily verified in both quantitative and qualitative perspectives using those platforms. Such services as Elsevier’s Scopus propose inbuilt functions to explore corpuses chronologically and geographically. They don’t, however, allow for hand curation and enrichment of the corpus. This lecture advocates for a solution to this methodological issue using PANDORÆ, a free and open source software designed for that purpose. PANDORÆ requests corpuses from the Scopus API, enriches its data by geolocating each document’s affiliations, and then uploads the resulting dataset to a Zotero library. The user is then free to curate the corpus, adding, editing or removing items. PANDORÆ allows downloading it back from Zotero to its internal databases, and to display the enriched corpuses on a map, on a timeline, or as an author-directed force-layout network graph.</p>

      <p>This presentation will also introduce more advanced PANDORAE features, such as displaying Twitter dataset obtained through Gazouilloire, mapping web entities loaded from Hyphe and scraping biorXiv results using Artoo.</p>

PANDORÆ allows downloading it back from Zotero to its internal databases, and to display the enriched corpuses on a map, on a timeline, or as an author-directed force-layout network graph.</p>

      <p>This presentation will also introduce more advanced PANDORAE features, such as displaying Twitter dataset obtained through Gazouilloire, mapping web entities loaded from Hyphe and scraping biorXiv results using Artoo.</p>

    description: |-
      <p>A network protocol stack can be implemented as a library. There are several examples: lwip/lwipv6, picoxnet, lkl.

      <p>The term brain-computer interface is well known among engineers, tinkerers, and specifically among researchers. Companies like BackYard Brains made it accessible for all at a relatively affordable price, with their initiative of neuroscience for all. The price of their device and the ease of usability it comes with is pretty good for a school student who's just looking for an introduction to neuroscience but, the resolution of Arduino's ADC (10bit) doesn't allow it to be used for any real neuroscience research project. The company called OpenBCI also creates some good hardware for Biopotential amplification (4/8ch 24bit) and their hardware is much more capable but, it's very costly and certainly not for everybody.</p>

      <p>As an engineer myself, I believe we can create much cheaper hardware for Brain-Computer interface devices than currently available in the market without losing any signal quality. I have started working on some prototypes already and one of the devices is called Upside Down Labs BioAmp v1.5 (github.com/upsidedownlabs/udlabs<em>BioAmp</em>v1.5) which takes benefit of the already available high-resolution ADC input of your computer which is normally used to record audio. The device basically converts the muscle into an audio source and provides us with the option to directly listen to it using earphones OR to visualize/record the signal on our mobile/laptop using Audacity/BYB Spike Recorder.</p>

      <p>In this talk, I'd like to give brief information about how to shard your data under MariaDB topologies and the possibility of using frameworks such as Vitess. While discussing the pros and cons of sharding I would like to showcase how structured horizontal sharding can scale your database almost infinitely. The audience will benefit from how others sharding to scale unlimited under both cloud and Kubernetes realm.
      In this short talk, I'd like to demo a case study that can be an example to get started for many.</p>
    description: "<p>Vitess is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling
      of MySQL through sharding. By enabling shard-routing logic, Vitess allows application
      code and database queries to remain agnostic to the distribution of data onto
      multiple shards. With Vitess, you can split, merge, and migrate shards as your
      needs grow. With its compatibility to development frameworks and integration
      to open-source tools, Vitess has been a core component of several high traffic
      OLTP sites around the world and serving data across different platforms. Vitess
      is also the first Linux Foundation/Cloud Native Computing Foundation graduated
      open-source database project.</p>"

      <p>This talk aims to give a user’s perspective on FLOSS tools for open research in social science. It will be based on personal experience with a team project that aimed to analyze the Twitter follow graph of last year’s FOSDEM and CHAOSScon participants. The project used open source tools and agile  management: data was collected with a command line tool (Twarc), network visualization was done with Gephi, and Framagit provided a collaborative framework for managing code, data, visualization and text.</p>

      <p>Implementing this project led to insight about what it takes for social scientists who have minimal tech knowledge and culture, to practice open research with FLOSS tools. This talk will specifically address three types of challenges I faced : training, documenting, and collaborating.</p>
    description: "<p>This talk will be particularly relevant for people who are designing
      FLOSS tools in interdisciplinary research environments. More generally, it can

      <p>Ever found an interesting PCB design, but you are not able to open it with your favorite program? The world of EDA file formats is divided by vendors, with low flexibility to move from one program to another one. The design is for a proprietary program? Well you need to either buy the program, or hope to convert it to your favorite file-format using an error-prone conversation process. Not ideal, but better than nothing.</p>

      <p>This talk will show you the basics to write an importer yourself, with focus on reverse-engineering of the questionable file-format. Thus, going from seemingly arbitrary zeros and ones to the basic file structure and the actual data such as a track. While this is quite easy for text-based files such as the KiCad file format, binary files can be seen more like a puzzle to solve.</p>

      <p>CadQuery (CQ) [1] is a Python library for building of parametric 3D models. The overarching design goal is to provide a fluent API that enables the user to express the design in a natural way. CQ is based on the open source CAD kernel from OpenCascade [2] and therefore offers industry standard B-Rep modeling capabilities and allows exporting to STEP and many other formats.</p>

      <p>With the upcoming 2.1 release [3] there many improvements coming to CQ. I will briefly summarize them but will focus on the new assembly system. The new CQ version allows the user to combine individual CQ objects into an assembly with the possibility of nesting. The individual object positions can be specified manually in terms of constraints that are solved using a numerical solver. Once an assembly is defined and all the positions specified it can be exported to STEP preserving the assembly structure or an internal OpenCascade XML format. In the I will discuss the current assembly system design, capabilities, limitations and possible future development directions.</p>

      <p>The architecture, engineering, and construction industry is a vast, diverse, but highly proprietary field. The primary means of data exchange between architects, structural, MEPF engineers, cost planners, surveyors, program schedulers, asset/facility management and more revolve around a concept known as Building Information Modeling (BIM) in addition to CAD. Many of these tools do not exist as free software, or are drastically better, or are dominated by a monopoly vendor market with lock-in business practices.</p>

      <p>Free software implementations of BIM have seen rapid growth in the past year, with new utilities available for OpenBIM building models, quality auditing, diffing, clash detection, issue management, facility management, environmental simulation, and more. This is supported by a newly formed community known as OSArch. Dion Moult, a main developer of the BlenderBIM Add-on, IfcOpenShell contributor, and one of the OSArch founders, will present a summary of these events, demonstrate how free software communities have collaborated and shared resources, and where this leads in the future. The BlenderBIM Add-on was recently awarded the buildingSMART 2020 Awards in Technology, the international standards body for BIM.</p>

      <p>Etebase is a software development kit and backend for building end-to-end encrypted applications. Think Firebase, but encrypted in a way that only end-users can access their data.</p>

      <p>This is in contrast to how things are done today where the data is only encrypted while in-transit or at-rest, and is therefore accessible by anyone with access to the server, including service providers, rogue employees, hackers, and malicious governments to name a few.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>This is not a theoretical threat. We live in an increasingly hostile digital world where out data is used to track, analyze and manipulate us all. With data breaches and privacy violations becoming a common occurrence, it's now more clear than even that our data is not safe.</p>

      <p>Our goal with Etebase is to make it easy for developers to build encrypted applications, so that everyone's data can be encrypted and safe.</p>

      <p>Etebase already powers the popular EteSync encrypted applications, and is also used in GNOME (Evolution) and KDE (KDE-PIM) among other projects. There are libraries for Rust, JavaScript (TypeScript), Java/Kotlin, Python, C/C++, and C#, with a few others in the works. Which means you can already use it in a variety of projects.</p>

      <p>In this talk Tom will introduce the Etebase project, will show developers how to easily build encrypted and privacy respecting applications, and will discuss the project's design goals and future plans.</p>

      <p>The work on Etebase has been made possible with financial support from NLnet Foundation, courtesy of NGI0 Discovery and the European Commission DG CNECT's Next Generation Internet programme.</p>

      <p>The IP Multimedia Subsystem is an architectural
      network for delivering IP multimedia services and data. The IMS
      network has built on three layers which allows for the convergence
      of different access networks. Each layer in IMS is consisting of
      various elements and protocols that consequently process signaling
      or media flow to specific application service. While the Call Session
      Control Function (CSCF) is the main route decision of the IMS
      network, the most significant of resources are used by routing and
      delivering media flow in Transport data layer in IMS network.
      With raising of request for service in IMS, the usage of resource
      have been increased. The ingress and egress nodes in IMS network
      are critical points and could potentially being bottleneck because
      they have to transmit huge signaling and media packets from and
      to IMS network. In this paper, we focused on Transport data layer
      on Edge-Border IMS network to manage and optimize its
      resources. We propose a new model of proxy that is called LREProxy.
      We implement LREProxy as new module for Kamailio, Open Source SIP Server.</p>

      <p>In any block-oriented, update-in-place database with log-based recovery, two kinds of page flushing are needed. Eviction flushing is necessary when all least recently used blocks are dirty (modifications exist in the buffer pool). Checkpoint flushing (writing out the oldest modified page first) allows the log checkpoint to advance, shortening the potential recovery time by logically discarding the start of the log. Any write of a persistent page must be preceded by a corresponding log write and optional doublewrite, to guarantee that crash recovery works.</p>

      <p>This session reveals four experimental Vitess developments that automate away complex database operations. With these developments Vitess is able to run its own database infrastructure, transparently to the user, and take control of risky and elaborate situations and operations.</p>

      <p>We will briefly explain the Vitess architecture and how it supports said control, and discuss the following developments:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Throttling: pushback for massive writes.</li>
      <li>Table life cycle: safe and lazy DROP TABLE operations.</li>
      <li>Online DDL: automating, scheduling and managing online schema migrations.</li>
      <li>HA, failovers and cluster healing via vitess/orchestrator (aka vtorc).</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Vitess is a CNCF open source database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL.</p>

      <p>This session reveals four experimental Vitess developments that automate away complex database operations. With these developments Vitess is able to run its own database infrastructure, transparently to the user, and take control of risky and elaborate situations and operations.</p>

      <p>We will briefly explain the Vitess architecture and how it supports said control, and discuss the following developments:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Throttling: pushback for massive writes.</li>
      <li>Table life cycle: safe and lazy DROP TABLE operations.</li>
      <li>Online DDL: automating, scheduling and managing online schema migrations.</li>
      <li>HA, failovers and cluster healing via vitess/orchestrator (aka vtorc).</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Vitess is a CNCF open source database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL.</p>

      <p>While the Ostinato traffic generator can import, edit and replay packets from PCAP files, most users prefer to craft packets from scratch using the Ostinato GUI which has support for common protocols out of the box. To add more protocols quickly and easily, Ostinato has a Protocol Builder framework using which new protocols can be added.</p>

      <p>In this talk, Ostinato creator Srivats P shows you how to add a new protocol using this framework.</p>

      <p>The database market is changing drastically in ways no one imagined 5 years ago. Database vendors are moving away from traditional deployment methods and embracing database as a service (DBaaS) as the default method to offer their database technologies to consumers and users. Much of this movement has been built because of the success and popularity of DBaaS offerings by major cloud vendors. Unfortunately, this is leading to a new era of NROSS (Not really open source) technologies that pretend to be free, open, and transparent but simply are not.
      As people wake up from the hangover’s caused by the incompatibilities, lack of portability, and increased costs they are looking at how to reclaim the openness, transparency, and freedom true OpenSource has provided them in the past. We will explore the trends and give his opinions and ideas on how we need to disrupt the current trends to keep open source open, and give users the freedom of having a quality alternative.</p>

    abstract: <p>Financing open source using tax breaks on donations made to endowment
      funds or general interest associations is a construct available in France and
      a viable alternative to R&amp;D expenditures for sponsoring open source projects.
      We will present several initiatives from the Libre Endowment Fund ("Fonds de
      Dotation du Libre" in French) - from financing feature development of open source
      software to releasing a 4G/5G base station as open source hardware or supporting
      litigation against the French government's decision to host Health Data on Microsoft
      servers.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The recently published FOSS contributor report showed that 48.7% of contributors were paid for their contributions by their employer with only 2.95% being paid by a third party. So even today as (open source) software continues to eat the world, almost half of all projects lack the financial base for ensuring their respective software's long-term existence.</p>

      <p>To finance the long term maintenance of its open source software stack, Nexedi has created the Libre Endowment Fund ("Fonds de Dotation du Libre" or FDL in French). It is a French endowment fund which complies with strict auditing procedures. With this status, French Law permits corporations and individuals to donate to the FDL and claim back up to 60% from future income taxes (65% for individuals). Rather than investing directly in the maintenance or continuous development of own or third party solutions, Nexedi and other companies (ex. Amarisoft) can pool donations which then support the maintenance or development of open source software, open source hardware or open services.</p>

      <p>During the last three years, FDL has been involved in a variety of projects:</p>

      <p>1) "Open Source Software" - FDL sponsored the development of Jexcel v4, an open source online spreadsheet editor ;</p>

      <p>2) "Open Source Hardware" - FDL has acquired the technological assets for a remote radio head (RHH) and is about to publish its PCB design and BOM under open source licence. It will be the first open source carrier-grade 4G/5G base station ;</p>

      <p>3) "Open Service" - FDL is supporting the launch of an initiative called "HyperOpen" for cloud solutions built using open source software, open hardware and open service. Open Service applies to the service industry the four freedoms of Free Free Software. With Open Service, everyone can use a service, study how a service is made, modify the service and become provider of that service. It is a generic principle, that in theory can be applied to services beyond the cloud.</p>

      <p>4) "Open Data" - FDL maintains a directory of European Open Source software publishers and their success cases. This directory is shared and contributed as open data (JSON) through pull-requests on a git platform.</p>

      <p>5) "Open Policy" - FDL is helping to sponsor the legal cost of Santenathon, a group of IT companies and non-profit organisations who have recently succeeded in a court case asking the French government's Health Data Hub to stop collecting personal data of french citizens and to migrate their solution from Microsoft to a European provider.</p>

      <p>The examples should highlight that provided the legal conditions in a respective country, funding of FLOSS solutions and related general interest projects can be partially subsidized by tax exemptions. It is important to notice that strict accounting and reporting rules apply in order to ensure juridical safety of the donor. FDL is managed using an open source ERP by a professional accountant and auditor. Those costs can be shared among the different projects.</p>

      <p>FDL also benefits from a scientific board of advisors which include three developers of open source software (Jean-Paul Smets, Stéfane Fermigier, Gaël Varoquaux) who also hold a PhD in computer science or mathematics. This scientific board follows the same procedures as governement sponsored RTD projects and thus also contributes to the juridical safety of FDL.</p>

      <p>Performance is a crucial property of software for both closed and open source software. Assuring that performance requirements are met in the CI process using benchmarks or load tests requires heavy manual effort for benchmark and load test specification. Unit tests often cover a big share of the use cases of a software and are maintained anyway. While they have some downsides for measuring the performance, e.g. since they test corner cases or use functional utilities like mocks, they still are a way of measuring realistic use cases with nearly no manual effort.</p>

      <p>Therefore, we develop the tool Peass (https://github.com/DaGeRe/peass), which transforms unit tests into performance unit tests and measures their performance. The stand-alone tool Peass can be integrated into the CI-process using Peass-CI, which makes it possible to run performance tests with every build in Jenkins.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The talk starts by introducing the basic idea of Peass.</p>

      <p>Then, the steps of the current prototype of Peass are presented:
      - a regression test selection, which prunes all unit tests that can not have a performance change by comparison of the execution traces of the same unit tests in two software versions and the source code of the called methods,
      - a measurement method, which repeats VM starts and measurement iterations inside the VM until the performance change can be statistically reliably detected and
      - a root cause analysis, which identified the node of the call tree which causes a performance change by measurement of individual nodes.</p>

      <p>Finally, the talk demonstrates the usage of Peass in a running Jenkins instance.</p>

      <p>Globaleaks is an AGPLv3+ SaaS application for anonymous whistleblowing, developed by the Hermes center for transparency and digital human rights. After receiving a prototype, the Italian Anticorruption authority (ANAC) re-published a modified version (developed via a public tender) under EUPL, modifying attribution &amp; copyright statement, removing reasonable notice from GUI, and failing to fully comply with the obligation to convey the corresponding source code. After several attempts for an off-court solution, the question was finally settled by the parties, restoring the correct license, and the other issues. There are several lessons to be learned by this controversy. License compatibility and the other free software obligations (including conveying the corresponding source code) are not to be taken lightly, and require a good degree of knowledge and expertise, especially when they are related to an application which has been implemented by several Public administrations</p>

      <p>Speakers:

      <p>Globaleaks is an AGPLv3+ SaaS application for anonymous whistleblowing, developed by the Hermes center for transparency and digital human rights. After receiving a prototype, the Italian Anticorruption authority (ANAC) re-published a modified version (developed via a public tender) under EUPL, modifying attribution &amp; copyright statement, removing reasonable notice from GUI, and failing to fully comply with the obligation to convey the corresponding source code. After several attempts for an off-court solution, the question was finally settled by the parties, restoring the correct license, and the other issues. There are several lessons to be learned by this controversy. License compatibility and the other free software obligations (including conveying the corresponding source code) are not to be taken lightly, and require a good degree of knowledge and expertise, especially when they are related to an application which has been implemented by several Public administrations</p>

      <p>WebRTC means many things to many people. One of these things is the C++ library that is used to implement the WebRTC functionality such as audio, video and data channels in the Chrome browser.
      The library is a complex beast with more than a million lines of code and a history dating back to 2004. It implements a wide range of network protocols and audio/video codecs.
      The interaction between WebRTC and Chrome is heavily influencing the how features are developed, reviewed and shipped to millions of users.
      In order to successfully contribute one has to understand both the tooling as well as the review process and how changes get into Chrome eventually.</p>

      <p>I am going to explain that process using two examples:
      - a trivial logging change
      - a feature to enable audio redundancy</p>

      <p>The logging change, while trivial, is a great example of the mechanics how a change gets uploaded, reviewed and shipped.</p>

      <p>Audio redundancy is a complex feature that attempts to solve a very hard problem, audio quality. Getting that feature considered even required data about the efficiency.
      The implementation turned out to be relatively complex, involving ten different changes in total.
      While implemented in the WebRTC library, it has not yet been shipped enabled by default in Chrome since evaluating and tuning the implementation at scale in the real world is difficult.</p>

      <p>Contributing back to the WebRTC library may be difficult, it is possible and contributions are welcomed. We just need more of them!</p>

      <p>Network security practitioners frequently need to correlate logs and alerts produced by the systems installed in their networks. For example, a Suricata alert might require the context of Zeek's connection logs for the alert to become actionable. Normally the best way to make such correlations is by manually identifying the flow tuple involved, in each of the monitor outputs involved, around the timestamps in question -- a tedious and error-prone task.</p>

      <p>To simplify this process we're standardizing a straightforward algorithm, dubbed "Community ID" (https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec), that produces short textual hashes that reliably identify network flows directly at the source. Flow correlation then becomes a straightforward string comparison operation. Popular open-source network monitoring solutions now include support for this emerging standard, including Suricata, Wireshark, and Zeek, and there's a growing library of reusable implementations in various common programming languages.</p>

      <p>In this talk we will motivate the Community ID standard, report on its current implementation status, and demonstrate it to the community.</p>

    abstract: |-
      <p>The debate on how to deploy applications, monoliths or micro services, is in
      full swing. Part of this discussion relates to how the new paradigm
      incorporates support for accessing accelerators, e.g. GPUs, FPGAs. That kind of
      support has been made available to traditional programming models the last
      couple of decades and its tooling has evolved to be stable and standardized
      (eg. CUDA, OpenCL/OpenACC, Tensorflow etc.).</p>

      <p>On the other hand, what does it mean for a highly distributed application
      instance (i.e. a Serverless deployment) to access an accelerator? Should the
      function invoked to classify an image, for instance, link against the whole
      acceleration runtime and program the hardware device itself? It seems quite
      counter-intuitive to create such bloated functions.</p>

      <p>Things get more complicated when we consider the low-level layers of the
      service architecture. To ensure user and data isolation, infrastructure
      providers employ virtualization techniques. However, generic hardware
      accelerators are not designed to be shared by multiple untrusted tenants.
      Current solutions (device passthrough, API-remoting) impose inflexible setups,
      present security trade-offs and add significant performance overheads.</p>

      <p>To this end, we introduce vAccel, a lightweight framework to expose hardware
      acceleration functionality to VM tenants. Our framework is based on a thin
      runtime system, vAccelRT, which is, essentially, an acceleration API: it offers
      support for a set of operators that use generic hardware acceleration
      frameworks to increase performance, such as machine learning and linear algebra
      operators. vAccelRT abstracts away any hardware/vendor-specific code by
      employing a modular design where backends implement bindings for popular
      acceleration frameworks and the frontend exposes a function prototype for each
      available acceleration function. On top of that, using an optimized paravirtual
      interface, vAccelRT is exposed to a VM’s user-space, where applications can
      benefit from hardware acceleration via a simple function call.</p>

      <p>In this talk we present the design and implementation of vAccel on two KVM
      VMMs: QEMU and AWS Firecracker. We go through a brief design description and
      focus on the key aspects of enabling hardware acceleration for machine learning
      inference for ligthweight VMs both on x86_64 and aarch64 architectures. Our
      current implementation supports CUDA, OpenCL, and jetson-inference out of the
      box.</p>

      <p>Finally, we present a demo of vAccel in action, using a containerized environment
      to simplify configuration &amp; deployment</p>

    raw_abstract: |-
      <p>The debate on how to deploy applications, monoliths or micro services, is in
      full swing. Part of this discussion relates to how the new paradigm
      incorporates support for accessing accelerators, e.g. GPUs, FPGAs. That kind of
      support has been made available to traditional programming models the last
      couple of decades and its tooling has evolved to be stable and standardized
      (eg. CUDA, OpenCL/OpenACC, Tensorflow etc.).</p>

      <p>On the other hand, what does it mean for a highly distributed application
      instance (i.e. a Serverless deployment) to access an accelerator? Should the
      function invoked to classify an image, for instance, link against the whole
      acceleration runtime and program the hardware device itself? It seems quite
      counter-intuitive to create such bloated functions.</p>

      <p>Things get more complicated when we consider the low-level layers of the
      service architecture. To ensure user and data isolation, infrastructure
      providers employ virtualization techniques. However, generic hardware
      accelerators are not designed to be shared by multiple untrusted tenants.
      Current solutions (device passthrough, API-remoting) impose inflexible setups,
      present security trade-offs and add significant performance overheads.</p>

      <p>To this end, we introduce vAccel, a lightweight framework to expose hardware
      acceleration functionality to VM tenants. Our framework is based on a thin
      runtime system, vAccelRT, which is, essentially, an acceleration API: it offers
      support for a set of operators that use generic hardware acceleration
      frameworks to increase performance, such as machine learning and linear algebra
      operators. vAccelRT abstracts away any hardware/vendor-specific code by
      employing a modular design where backends implement bindings for popular
      acceleration frameworks and the frontend exposes a function prototype for each
      available acceleration function. On top of that, using an optimized paravirtual
      interface, vAccelRT is exposed to a VM’s user-space, where applications can
      benefit from hardware acceleration via a simple function call.</p>

      <p>In this talk we present the design and implementation of vAccel on two KVM
      VMMs: QEMU and AWS Firecracker. We go through a brief design description and
      focus on the key aspects of enabling hardware acceleration for machine learning
      inference for ligthweight VMs both on x86_64 and aarch64 architectures. Our
      current implementation supports CUDA, OpenCL, and jetson-inference out of the
      box.</p>

      <p>Finally, we present a demo of vAccel in action, using a containerized environment
      to simplify configuration &amp; deployment</p>

      <p>Musicians, producers and composers use digital audio workstations (DAW) in daily work. You've probably seen beautiful photos from recording studios: a sound engineer is sitting in front of several monitors with multi track recording application windows and dialogs?! This is the DAW.</p>

      <p>But what's about to run DAS (Digital Audio Server): the server instance with DAW benefits + multi client access from web, compatibility with popular cloud services, FOSS and Raku-driven backend.</p>

      <p>In this lecture we will consider DAS backend as a JRP pipeline — JUCE + RAKU + PHEIX, focus on each component and demonstrate Raku as the tool for unusual daily programming tasks.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>When we talk about sound processing on the remote server or cloud, we assume the set of various web audio services: AI composers, recognizers (stylistic classifiers, plagiarism scanners, audio content reviewers), co-creativity, etc... Each of these services bases on headless processing and mixing audio backend. Actually this is a Digital Audio Server (similar to a DAW), providing multitrack recording, mixing and processing in real time via API.</p>

      <p>The fundamental differences between DAS and DAW are: Linux platform, no GUI and the TCP/IP stack as the only data transport. In this paradigm we can define DAS software as Linux + headless audio backend.</p>

      <p>Frontend provides visualization of processes on the backend, works in the context of web browser on client workstation and interacts with the backend via, for example, REST-API.</p>

      <p>This talk defines the DAS headless audio backend as a JRP pipeline —  JUCE + RAKU + PHEIX.</p>

      <p>The JUCE framework has the large set of the tools and features required for audio processing. It is one of the most well-documented, actively evolved and powerful audio frameworks with the Linux support.</p>

      <p>The PHEIX content management system is used to interact with the frontend. It is currently the only CMS with Ethereum Blockchain native support. For the audio industry, in terms of copyright protection, this is definitely a must-have solution — since all metadata passing through the Digital Audio Server can be stored in a distributed ledger (both private and public, for example, the Görli network) and used for copyright disputes in future.</p>

      <p>PHEIX is written in the RAKU language: the most promising and at the same time underrated programming language. In JRP concept — RAKU is the glue for the DAS backend components on the one hand, and the high-level adapter for the JUCE application on the other.</p>

      <p>In the practical part of this lecture, we will consider the sample web audio service for frequency analysis and audio content visualization. The example demonstrates methods for creating and deploying a JUCE application as a shared library on a Linux platform. We will pass the step-by-step dev process of the RAKU application-level module with a JUCE bindings, make an integration into PHEIX and try it all from the simple frontend.</p>

      <p>This lecture primarily aimed at architects and programmers of web audio services, JUCE community members with Linux background, and RAKU enthusiasts who are involved in digital audio processing.</p>

      Any changes to the working production environment would surely make DBA/dev-ops anxious and we are talking about migrating to a different architecture altogether. How complex is that? Is it feasible? Is it the right time to look into it? What about the ecosystem/other aspects?</p>

      <p>Every software ecosystem seems to have a package manager these days, but reusing software <em>across</em> these ecosystems is still a challenge.  Major Linux distributions package software from a wide range of languages, but they restrict the versions you can install, and they make deep assumptions about compilers and runtime libraries to keep everything compatible. If you need a newer libc or a newer Python than the OS offers, you're often on your own.  Python packaging supports native libraries, but it imposes strict rules on package builders to ensure that the binaries work in many places.  Some packagers break the rules, e.g., TensorFlow binary packages (wheels) will only work on Ubuntu, frustrating users of other distributions. Containers provide some hope, but only if you stay inside their sandbox. If you your container to talk to a fast network or a GPU, you'll need to ensure binary compatibility between the container and the host OS. Is every ecosystem a walled garden or can we make it easier to bridge the gap?</p>

      <p>This talk takes a deeper look at the Application Binary Interface (ABI) and its place at the heart of nearly every software ecosystem.  We'll look at the assumptions made by modern dependency management systems about toolchains and ABI.  Most tools assume that toolchains and ABI are fixed, making it hard to take a package from one ecosystem and transplant it in another.  We'll talk about how we can build dependency managers that can <em>reason</em> better about ABI compatibility, making decisions not just about which software versions to install but also about how those software versions should be built. We'll look at the types of metadata that need to be managed to enable a more flexible software environment, and how it affects the complexity of dependency resolution.  Finally, we'll look at how some of these issues are being addressed in Spack, an open source package manager for high performance computing applications, which can span multiple languages, compilers, platforms, and software stacks.</p>

      <p>Pull is one of the time-consuming steps in the container lifecycle. One of the root causes is the current OCI Image Spec that cannot run containers before the entire image contents being locally available.</p>

      <p>Stargz Snapshotter is a subproject of containerd that tries to solve this problem by "lazy pulling" - starting up containers without waiting for the entire image contents are downloaded but necessary chunks are fetched on-demand. This project proposes OCI-alternative but OCI-compatible lazy-pullable image format eStargz. In this session, Kohei, one of the initial maintainers of Stargz Snapshotter project, will show an introduction to this project and the recent integration activities with tools in the community.</p>
    description: <p>In this session, Kohei will show the overview of Stargz Snapshotter
      including eStargz structure and its optimization and content verification, the
      lazy pulling technique done by this snapshotter and the relationship between
      this snapshotter and containerd's remote snapshotter feature. He will also talk
      about recent integration activities with tools, including fast image build by
      lazy pulling of "base" images on BuildKit, quick containers startup on Kubernetes.
      Recent standardization activity of eStargz to OCI Image Spec will also be covered.</p>

      <p>Kubernetes, GitOps, and Infrastructure as Code are as powerful as they are popular and seem like the perfect match. Consequently, using Terraform to maintain Kubernetes clusters and resources is a very common use-case. And it requires careful integration of many moving parts, from Terraform providers and modules, to CI/CD pipelines and triggers.</p>

      <p>However, despite this being such a popular use-case, teams previously had no alternative than writing everything from scratch. On the software development side we use frameworks to avoid reinventing the wheel for similarly common use-cases. But for the less mature infrastructure as code ecosystem use-case specific frameworks are a new concept.</p>

      <p>This talk will introduce Kubestack. An open-source framework for Terraform, that brings the developer experience of frameworks from application development to infrastructure as code. Get an overview of how you can use the framework as a foundation to build even advanced multi-cloud and multi-cluster Kubernetes automation. And how Kubestack's GitOps workflow allows teams to reliably suggest, review, validate and apply changes to their infrastructure environments.</p>

      <p>Although Kubernetes is the leading container orchestration solution, it does not necessarily solve all container management-related challenges that one might face. Leaving fashions aside, some other technologies may actually be a better solution for some use cases and projects. Kubernetes is actually a very complex technology, with limited support for multi-tenancy and lacking secure isolation between tenants. Kubernetes does not offer cloud-like self-service provision features for users either. Cloud providers and cloud management tools try to bridge these gaps by offering managed Kubernetes-as-a-Service platforms, adding an extra control layer that ends up increasing management complexity, resource consumption and associated costs.</p>

      <p>OpenNebula brings exciting new features to the container orchestration ecosystem. OpenNebula’s recent integration with Docker Hub provides users with immediate access to official Docker images. Now they can be easily imported into an OpenNebula cloud and orchestrated as a KVM-based virtual machine, as a LXD system container or even as a Firecracker micro-VM. With its native support for multi-tenancy, self-service provision and secure isolation between tenants, OpenNebula has become a simpler alternative to Kubernetes to easily set up multi-tenant Containers-as-a-Service on private, hybrid and edge cloud environments.</p>

      <p>In this talk we will show a live demo on how to automatically deploy a Containers-as-a-Service on the edge to orchestrate multi-container applications using OpenNebula’s recent integration with the Docker Hub marketplace.</p>

      <p>Openchain is a comprehensive set of requirements allowing to cope with the open source compliance challenge. Recently it even has been accepted as ISO standard. However, compliance in todays world is not possible without tool support. To get a grip on the different tools, understand what they can do and where their limitations are, the OC tooling workgroup decided to develop a capability model. This model outlines all required capabilities to cope with the open source challenge and allows to map the functionality of tools. Thus the model can be seen as a map through the djungle of tools.
      In this talk, Jan will introduce the model as well as briefly outline the most relevant capabilities. Links to further resources as well as first maps will be provided.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Open Source Compliance (OSC) is not a might anymore. It is part of good manufacturing practise. Since manufacturing and software grow closer, the insight that not only the Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) become essential for maintainability and security of software but also the legal documentation can't be seen as a once printed and never read paperwork anymore. The acceptance of CI/CD as development best practise and the ever growing amount of components used from open source stacks and their imminent dependencies prevent further manual delivery of compliance artefacts.
      But what is required to cope with that challenge? Where do you have to put your efforts in? Which tools are the right tools to check for your purpose? To help you answer these questions, the Capability model has been designed.<br/>
      This talk introduces the motivation as well as the basic aspects of the model without going into details. Guiding thoughts and ideas will be transported as well as links for further studies will be provided.
      Finally the talk will conclude with a few mapping samples and an outlook in which directions the work will proceed.</p>

      <p>The combination of AsciiDoc and Gradle should be well known by now. But what if you want to go beyond? Have you ever tried to include UML diagrams the easy way, convert Excel to AsciiDoc or export your results to Confluence?
      This talk shows you what you can really do if you treat your docs as code and apply some tricks you only did to your code before.
      Forget about copy &amp; paste your images to your documentation – let the build do it!
      Create different docs for different stakeholders and even run automated tests on your docs!</p>

      <p>In this talk, Ralf will give an short overview of the open source documentation tool chain "docToolchain".
      He will open up the Docs-as-Code solution space with some new and fresh ideas and show where the Docs-as-Code approach is heading to.</p>

      <p>As the maintainer of the open source tool called "docToolchain", Ralf tries to push the Docs-as-Code approach further to its limits. Every new idea finds its place in the docToolchain. It is by now a collection of quite helpful tasks of your every day documentation needs.</p>

      <p>This talk assumes that you already know about the <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/">docs-as-code</a> approach and <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/">AsciiDoc</a>.</p>

      <p>docToolchain itself uses jBake to create a webpage but it will also play nicely together with Antora which is shown in the talk "<a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/ttdasciidocantora/">Creating a documentation site for users with AsciiDoc and Antora</a>" by Alexander Schwartz at 15:00.</p>

      <p>AsciiDoc can be converted out of the box to docBook. So I assume that most tools shown can be combined with approaches shown in the talk "<a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/ttdpostgresdocbook/">20 years with DocBook</a>" at 16:00.</p>

      <p>One billion people experience some sort of disability. At least 10% of the adult population has a vision impairment. And those are just numbers for people who have been tested and suffer from a long-term disability.</p>

      <p>By creating accessible products you can...
      * Improve the experience for all your users
      * Increase your user or community base
      * Cater to clients whose businesses have a mandatory accessibility requirement for the software that they use
      * Potentially expose areas in UI or user flow that need improvement</p>

    abstract: |-
      <p>The open source is getting mature and there are a lot of established ways of behavior, expectations even, that both contributors and maintainers of a codebase have. Some of these expectations are explicit in contributing files, whereas others are implicit and more of a cultural behaviour we as a group have taken on over the years. Governments and civil servants come from a very different background and when they start developing publishing software in the open under a free licenses, these cultures may meet, and sometimes even clash. We know that individual volunteer contributors differ from corporate contributors, how do public workers as contributors fit into this.</p>

      <p>How public workers contribute has to do with how they operate, and how the society expect them operate in other fields of their operation. If not understood properly, this can lead to frustration of a FOSS contributor who want to make a useful contribution to a codebase developed by a public organization.

    raw_abstract: |-
      <p>The open source is getting mature and there are a lot of established ways of behavior, expectations even, that both contributors and maintainers of a codebase have. Some of these expectations are explicit in contributing files, whereas others are implicit and more of a cultural behaviour we as a group have taken on over the years. Governments and civil servants come from a very different background and when they start developing publishing software in the open under a free licenses, these cultures may meet, and sometimes even clash. We know that individual volunteer contributors differ from corporate contributors, how do public workers as contributors fit into this.</p>

      <p>How public workers contribute has to do with how they operate, and how the society expect them operate in other fields of their operation. If not understood properly, this can lead to frustration of a FOSS contributor who want to make a useful contribution to a codebase developed by a public organization. In this talk we will try to give you the tools and the mindset that will help you succeed when submitting those merge requests.</p>

      <p>I plan to bring modern OO to the Perl core. Modern enough that it leapfrogs the capabilities of the OO systems of many other dynamic languages. I’ve been stealing ideas from Stevan Little, Damian Conway, and anyone else foolish enough to leave their ideas lying around. I have no pride. Sawyer’s expressed interest and it's likely it will go into the Perl core, though with the upcoming Perl governance changes, the timeline is unclear.</p>

      <p>I’m not going to beat around the bush: writing object-oriented code in Perl is a shambolic mess. Some people want to use bless and hand-roll everything, others insist upon using Moo/se, while still others others reach for Class::Std, Spiffy, Class::Tiny, some in-house monstrosity their company uses and so on. You have to relearn it again and again and again. It's time to put this embarrassment aside.</p>

      <p>Three phrases keep popping up when talking about modern workflows and development and deployment techniques. We have continuous delivery to automate the complete lifecycle of applications from a commit to a Git repository, all the way until a release is deployable to production. Then we have GitOps to define the desired states of our environments and let the machines handle the converge the actual into the desired state. Finally, there is a lot of focus on different deployment strategies grouped under progressive delivery. They are all focused on the iterative release of features to make the process safe, prevent downtime, and reduce the blast radius of potential issues.</p>

      <p>While those three practices and the tooling behind those are focusing on specific areas, the "real" benefits are obtained when they are combined. Nevertheless, many did not yet reach that stage. Each of those practices alone can be daunting and, frankly, scary. Yet, we should go a step further and explore how to combine them together and see the benefits such a solution might provide.</p>

      <p>Through a hands-on demo, we will combine Argo CD as a tool of choice for applying GitOps, Argo Rollouts for progressive delivery, and Argo Workflows for continuous delivery pipelines that will tie those two together with the rest of the steps needed in the lifecycle of our applications. If we are successful, we might remove humans from all the actions coming after pushing changes to Git repositories.</p>

      <p>“We want (Exposing the Invisible) to inspire a new generation of people committed to transparency and accountability.” (Tactical Tech). Reverse-engineering consists in studying an object (or a method) in order to determine its internal functioning. Reverse-engineering consists in identifying a precise case, making a recognition, disassembling step by step and piece by piece, then understanding the mechanism; and finally reassembling the object (or the method) with a new value proposition in its operation.</p>

      <p>We are experimentally trying to revisit the practice of reverse-engineering to explore these possible and effective contributions in the case of investigation (journalism, activism, science, art).</p>

      <p>In investigations, reverse engineering can be valuable as a process of learning from scratch based on deconstructing existing case studies/investigations and being able to replicate in many cases at least the more accessible parts and processes, which led to the findings and evidence exposed.</p>

      <p>Today, organizations, events, collectives, are configuring themselves in a multidisciplinary way to tackle problems to be studied, to tackle problems to be solved. We are ourselves a group of people from different fields with different practices and skills - citizen investigators, journalists, researchers artists, technologists, etc. -- who want to demonstrate that learning to investigate can be made more accessible to local communities and individuals who may need to use such techniques in a safe, ethical and collaborative way in their own context.</p>

      <p>Reverse engineering practices allow us to consider these paradigms from different angles, then open windows, similar to those of open hardware and free open-source software, in the fields of environment, biology, health.</p>

      <p>Reverse-engineering as a process of deconstructing investigations, asking questions to figure out how they were made (methods, tools, resources needed, challenges, safety...)
      Taking something less understood or inaccessible to many and transforming it into something public -- reverse-engineering it back to the commons. The process is about finding the fundamental backbone of events, what is the part of the investigation that can be taken away.</p>

      <p>Reverse-engineering investigations implies to be able to reconstruct and experiment with the methods and information acquired in the initial process in order to visualize what elements are indispensable to how a "system" works. It also allows one to figure out what elements could be removed, replaced with more contextual information if the method can be replicated, or "hacked" to make the "system" or method work differently in other settings.</p>

      <p>Methodology &amp; Major Findings:</p>

      <p>We are experimentally trying to revisit the practice of reverse-engineering to explore these possible and effective contributions in the case of investigation (journalism, activism, science, art). We engage with different techniques, tools and methods along with the individual practices of those working at the new frontiers of investigation.</p>

      <p>We all come from very different research and professional backgrounds, use different methodologies and techniques, investigate very different things.</p>

      <p>From a software perspective, reverse-engineering is used for:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>industrial espionage</p></li>
      <li><p>cracking</p></li>
      <li><p>exploit creation</p></li>
      <li><p>security audit</p></li>
      <li><p>bug correction</p></li>
      <li><p>malware analysis</p></li>
      <li><p>interoperability</p></li>
      <li><p>scientific study</p></li>
      <li><p>fun.</p></li>
      </ul>


      <p>But one question that unites us all is: what do you do when faced with a "dark box"? A finished product or event that fascinates you, but its development process, features and functions are in some way hidden from sight. It could be a network, a photograph, an environmental catastrophe, a machine - something that in order to understand or act upon, you need to be able to reconstruct how it was made.</p>

      <p>We work with some non-negotiable constraints to this complex problem:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>intimacy &amp; privacy concerns of the practice used and the result</p></li>
      <li><p>low cost or free cost access</p></li>
      <li><p>accessible, affordable, usable</p></li>
      <li><p>no domination provided to a person who has scientific or technical knowledge, understanding or skill</p></li>
      <li><p>reliable, transparent, and readable result.</p></li>
      </ul>


      <p>When we share, give or receive information, during investigations or knowledge sharing sessions, we have the responsibility of explaining or demystifying a complex architectural object:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>we try to deal with a complex architectural object</p></li>
      <li><p>we often try to disassemble objects, even if we don’t really figure it out.</p></li>
      </ul>


      <p>Through several experimental residencies, educational workshops, operational implementations in the field, we have gained experience and opened up a few paths for collaboration on "Reverse before any action, reverse-engineering the existing rather than producing new dark boxes". Even some use cases of Reverse-engineering during investigation.</p>

      <p>Conclusion:</p>

      <p>By practicing reverse-engineering on a pregnancy urine test or on a digital photo with steganography in it people regain control over the information and the technique. Similarly, the method can be applied to investigations, especially the ones built on openly available information (see such cases here: https://kit.exposingtheinvisible.org/en/index.html) and with open source tools (including OSINT investigations but not only) as well as to more complex inquiries such as follow-the-money investigations, supply chain and much more. By reverse-engineering investigations, we can help demystify and expose the insides of a process that is often assumed to be exclusive to professional investigators (journalists, law enforcement, private investigators ..). Now we want to invite other communities of practice more broadly to contribute to our experimental approach − at the crossroads between investigation, science, and open tools and technologies in order to encourage more people to use investigation methods to understand their often non-transparent environments and find safe and ethical ways to ask and address the questions and problems affecting their communities.</p>

      <p>We also accept that our world is filled with objects from extractivist political choices supporting hyper-growth as a productive dogma.</p>

      <p>We take our responsibility here by opening a different path in the relationship to objects, which consists as much in the mastery of knowledge and techniques as in the perspective of disassembling and improving accessibility to the existing rather than extracting in order to overproduce the invading.</p>

      <p>WebRTC has played a vital role keeping us all connected in the last yea which has brought new developers into contact with it.
      Many are surprised and confused at how it works and the technical  decisions that were made. This talk aims to give some historical context to those choices.
      Hopefully this talk will reduce the confusion experience.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>By a series of accidents I was on the edge of webRTC development, before it was even a thing.
      I've been involved in the standardisation from early on to this day, implemented most of the APIs and met most of the people who worked on it.
      I'll talk about the starting point, the forks in the road, some of the mistakes made and what this project has made possible.</p>

      <p>Topics covered:
      Early history...
      Standards groups
      P2P vs client server
      RTP - why?
      Signalling and SDP
      Encryption - who do we trust ?
      DataChannel - choice of protocol
      Codec wars
      API abstraction level choice(s)</p>

      <p>This talk is entirely from my point of view, but may help listeners understand how a huge project like webRTC evolves.</p>

      Early history...
      Standards groups
      P2P vs client server
      RTP - why?
      Signalling and SDP
      Encryption - who do we trust ?
      DataChannel - choice of protocol
      Codec wars
      API abstraction level choice(s)</p>

      <p>This talk is entirely from my point of view, but may help listeners understand how a huge project like webRTC evolves.</p>

      <p>Heterogeneous architectures, composed of a pool of general-purpose processors and accelerators, on one hand offers the ability to balance the application performance, programming flexibility, and energy consumption. On the other hand, they give rise to a number of challenges on a) designing and implementing a suitable architecture for the needs of the target applications, b) deploying dynamic and low-overhead resource management strategies, and c) effectively enabling execution of pipelined workflows for streaming applications. Furthermore, application developers need productive tools to port their software-defined radio applications to increasingly heterogeneous SoCs.  We think that application developers should not waste their time reading datasheets or APIs for SoC-specific kernel extensions just to take full advantage of their hardware. With these in mind, this talk will discuss strategies we are using to address the aforementioned inter-related challenges through our vertically integrated compile-time and run-time environment CEDR: a Compiler-integrated, Extensible, DSSoC Runtime.</p>

      <p>CEDR is an open-source ecosystem that runs in Linux user-space and enables compilation and development of user applications, resource management strategies, and accelerator integration in one unified framework. CEDR supports highly recurring, stream-based application graphs through pipelined execution and processing element based work queues. CEDR is built on a thread-per-PE scheduling methodology,  enables integration of complex resource management heuristics that rely on  work queues and require reservation-based policies. CEDR  supports contemporary scheduling algorithms built on  imitation learning (IL) that uses complex schedulers offline to construct an Oracle and effortlessly replicates those decisions online using machine learning models such as regression trees and neural networks. We will demonstrate CEDR deployed on the Zynq UltraScale MPSoC by conducting execution time, throughput, resource utilization analysis through dynamically arriving workload scenarios composed of Radar and WiFi applications. We will demonstrate the distinct plug-and-play integration points offered by CEDR for application engineers and hardware architects through case studies that illustrate our ability to rapidly evaluate various configurations of applications, schedulers, and accelerator IPs.</p>

      <p>An Immutable OS is a GNU/Linux distribution where the user has limited (if at all!) changes to modify the root filesystem. And by "modify the root filesystem" we mean doing things like installing software with the package manager. Some examples of Immutable OSes that falls in this definition are Fedora Silverblue, openSUSE MicroOS, openSUSE Kubic and EndlessOS. In fact, on Fedora Silverblue, the user can't add software with <code>dnf</code>, not even after becoming "root". Similarly, on openSUSE MicroOS, <code>zypper install</code> just does not work. This brings the advantage of keeping the OS cleaner, consistent, reliable and a lot harder to break. For instance because what developers produce and tests is a lot more similar to what actual users use, with respect to what happens with "traditional OSes". And they usually come with a nice way of rolling back changes too, which is also really valuable.</p>

      <p>But what are the technologies behind all that? Well, there are a few, and although the outcome is rather similar, their inner working and characteristics are quite different. In this talk, we will focus on two: ostree and transactional-update. The forme is used in Silverblue and Endless OS, the latter in openSUSE MicroOS and Kubic. We will try to provide a description of how both work and what are the main differences between them.</p>

      <p>Even more important: what's the user experience with such distros? And what if one is not only a user, but a developer? Well, this talk will offer a perspective of how it is being to use one as one's own daily driver, for both user-like and developer-like tasks. That would be openSUSE MicroOS. We will cover what it is the current status of the "MicroOS as a Desktop" project, what are the current challenge and the upcoming developments. But we will also try to hint at how the user/developer experience may vary between MicroOS and others (more mature) immutable desktop solutions like Fedora Silverblue and Endless OS.</p>

    description: |-
      <p>Maintaining documentation for a project such as PostgreSQL comes with a number of challenges.  There are many challenges writing good documentation, but in this talk we'll focus on the tooling.  First, the documentation is quite big: In a printable format it is over 2000 pages.  This pushes many build tools beyond their limits.  And of course we also want documentation builds to finish in a reasonable time.  Second, we need tooling longevity and portability.  Database server software is long-running software.  We still need to be able to patch and rebuild everything many years from now.  In the world of writing and publishing tools, there is often a new idea every few years with many dependencies and no long-term track record, which makes it difficult for us to adopt things like that.  It took us many years to get just a few graphics into the documentation because the tooling issues were too overwhelming.</p>

      <p>DocBook has been good to us, but there have been plenty of struggles along the way, and there are some concerns about the future.</p>

Or another example: it can find credit card numbers in logs and remove them to comply with PCI-DSS. And syslog-ng can store logs not just to text files, but to databases, big data destinations, like Hadoop, or to Splunk or Elasticsearch as well.

      <p>The ReplicationWiki provides an overview of published empirical studies in the social sciences with information on data and code availability, data sources, and software. One can search for keywords, Journal of Economic Literature codes, and geographical origin of data. It informs about 670 replications, that is studies reanalyzing previously published results, as well as corrections and retractions.
      The wiki helps researchers to compare their results to those of previous studies. It is a resource that helps to identify useful teaching examples for statistical methods, replication and studies of social science. It allows advanced students and practicing researchers to find guidance on how to publish their replication research in various journals. A collection of teaching resources, useful tools, and literature helps instructors to integrate replication into their teaching and students to integrate open science practices into their own research. With the ongoing expansion of the wiki, currently covering more than 4,500 empirical studies, it is becoming an ever more powerful tool for social science research and education. It is a crowd-based platform where users can add their own replication results, suggest studies that should be replicated, and identify for example further data sources used in the empirical studies, especially ones from countries underrepresented in the literature and for whom economic policies are thus difficult to investigate.</p>
    description: "<p>The Wiki uses Semantic Media Wiki technology that is evolving,
      and a number of technical improvements in terms of usability and database structure
      are planned. A massive expansion of the content is planned based on machine
      learning and natural language processing techniques identifying the relevant
      information from the available data. For the technical improvements further
      expertise is welcome, and for the content expansion developers and researchers

      <p>Having started on a very typical path for open source projects - needing to solve our own problems - we were struck by the challenge that our technology wouldn’t be sufficient for our eventual goal: improving the culture and process of scientific publishing.

      <p>Having started on a very typical path for open source projects - needing to solve our own problems - we were struck by the challenge that our technology wouldn’t be sufficient for our eventual goal: improving the culture and process of scientific publishing. The challenge is not only technologically broad and complicated - but there are also enormous cultural and operational logistics needed to approach real solutions.  Not least of which is the ability to provide resource-constrained, technologically-limited organizations with the stability and support they need to make commitments that will last years if not decades.</p>

      <p>RAWGraphs is an open source web application for the creation of static data visualisations that are designed to be further modified. Originally conceived for graphic designers to provide a series of tasks not available with other tools, it evolved into a platform widely used in research and data journalism contexts that provides simple ways to map data dimensions onto visual variables. It presents a chart-based approach to data visualisation: each visual model is an independent module exposing different visual variables that can be used to map data dimensions. Consequently, users can create complex data visualisations. Finally, the tool is meant to produce outputs that are open, that is, not subjected to proprietary solutions, which can be further edited.
      Thanks to an intuitive user interface and experience drafting visualizations become an easy task, enabling the user to produce the visualizations not only as a mere output but also as a tool within the research process.
      Last year we launched a successful crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the redesign and development of a new version of RAWGraphs, that will be released in the first months of 2021.
      The new version is written from scratch with the aim to make the tool more flexible for customisation and to create an active community also on the development side.
      The talk aims at presenting how RAWGraphs has been used in research context and our strategies to keep the project free, open source, economically sustainable and independent.</p>

      - Containerized Data Importer
      - Scheduling, Scale and Performance
      - Cluster Network Addons
      - Node Maintenance

      <p>The Hyperconverged Cluster Operator delivers the domain-specific knowledge needed to orchestrate and automate the deployment and the upgrades of Kubevirt and its sibling operators in an opinionated and managed way.
      The Hyperconverged Cluster Operator can be installed on bare metal server clusters an a matter of minutes, even from a GUI, without requiring a deep knowledge of Kubernetes internals.
      The Hyperconverged Cluster Operator can be easily deployed in combination with rook.io to provide cloud native virtualization and distributed self-managing, self-scaling, self-healing storage services on a single cluster.</p>

      <p>An attendee will learn:
      - quick intro to KubeVirt technology  (virtualization add-on for Kubernetes)

      talk about the current status of the language and its nascent community, and
      look forward at what lies ahead for its future. We will discuss a bit about

      <p>In Part 1, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPyBQRndLUk">"Minimalism versus types"</a>, presented at FOSDEM 2019, we talked about the previous projects that aimed at producing typed variants of Lua, the challenges they faced, and the idea of trying again with a focus on minimalism and pragmatism.</p>

      <p>In Part 2, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfnjUCRzRKU">"Minimalistic typed Lua is here"</a>, presented at FOSDEM 2020, I presented the progress of the project, with a compiler that is able to type check itself and compile itself into Lua code. At that point, the language was still called tl.</p>

      <p>Now in Part 3, the language has a name (<a href="https://teal-language.org">Teal</a>!), and a growing community. In "What's next for Teal", I will report on the advances we've made in the last year, and also address the elephant in the room: people keep asking for features, the language keeps growing, the type system has already made it more complicated than Lua, what about the minimalism? For that, we need to go full circle, revisit what minimalism means in the context of types, and how to approach it in a Lua-like way.</p>

      <p>Matrix (https://matrix.org) is an open protocol for secure, decentralised communication - defining an end-to-end-encrypted real-time communication layer for the open Web.  Historically the network has been made up of newly written native Matrix clients, or bridges to 3rd party existing chat systems (e.g. Slack, Discord, Telegram).</p>

      <p>This year, however, we added production-grade native Matrix support for the first time to a major 3rd party chat system: Gitter (https://gitter.im) over the course of about 5 weeks.  This talk will explain how we did it it, and show how easily other existing chat systems can extend their reach into the whole Matrix ecosystem; breaking open those walled gardens forever.</p>

      <p>With the European Commission proposing to mandate interoperability for big tech "gatekeepers" (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip<em>20</em>2347), it's never been more relevant to understand how best to expose existing communication silos via open communication APIs such as Matrix.</p>

      <p>Between October &amp; December 2020 we happened to go through precisely this process - designing how best to make Gitter natively speak Matrix such that Matrix users can natively participate in all Gitter conversations, using it as the reference example of linking an existing large-scale chat silo into Matrix.  Do you try to natively speak the Matrix server-server API?  Or do you embed a homeserver (if so, which one?) and use the Application Service API?  Where do you store the data, and how do you minimise duplication between your existing service and Matrix?  How do you scale to a userbase of millions of users?  How do you handle end-to-end encryption?</p>

      <p>In this talk, we'll answer these questions; and show how we're at the point where Matrix has matured enough that it could actually be used to add open communication APIs to the tech giants if they ever found themselves in need.</p>

      <p>2020 was an isolating year. During a time of travel restrictions and social distancing, Mozilla Hubs (hubs.mozilla.com) provided a safe place for people to come together virtually. This open source project allows users to quickly create custom 3D spaces, and invite others to join using only a link. It is browser-based, and works across a wide variety of devices - no downloads required.</p>

      <p>From conferences, to weddings, to art galleries and even windsurfing lessons, over the last year we’ve seen a huge variety of creative applications that our team had never imagined. In this talk I showcase exciting work created by the Hubs community, and share specific insights learned while managing Hubs’ rapidly growing user-base.

      <p>Matrix (https://matrix.org) is an open protocol for secure, decentralised communication - defining an end-to-end-encrypted real-time communication layer for the open Web suitable for instant messaging, VoIP, microblogging, forums and more.  We provide the open standard and open source tools to democratise communication away from the proprietary closed communication silos (Slack, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp etc) that currently dominate.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we'll explain all the features we've been adding to let Matrix scale to support massive virtual communities such as FOSDEM itself, Mozilla, KDE and others.  This includes Spaces: the ability to group rooms into a hierarchy, for ease of discovery and management; Widgets: the ability to add arbitrary webapps to chatrooms to provide dashboards of additional functionality (e.g. the FOSDEM livestreams and video conferences); Threading: the ability (at last!) to support threaded conversations in Matrix; and Decentralised Reputation - the ability to empower users to tune out content they dislike on their own terms.  Our goal is to ensure no open source project ever uses Slack/Discord/Telegram to collaborate ever again.  Finally, we'll give a quick tour of the FOSDEM-specific work we've done in order to run FOSDEM 2021 on Matrix!</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Matrix has always been built to support large virtual communities - after all, Matrix itself and all its dependent projects are developed via Matrix.  Over the last year this has expanded further, with Mozilla joining Matrix in March 2020, Gitter joining in October - and meanwhile a huge influx of large virtual events and educational and public-sector deployments driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.  As a result, lots of our work in 2020 has been focused on improving features for navigating and managing large virtual communities, whether that's improving the user experience in Element, or adding entirely new features to the protocol.  We'll give a tour of what we've been doing, and how we deployed it for FOSDEM.  We'll also show off our brand new Spaces implementation (the ability to group rooms into a hierarchy).</p>

      <p>Spaces are particularly interesting because they open up the possibility of Matrix being more than just a big flat namespace of conversations: instead they provide a global fully decentralised hierarchical filesystem, complete with decentralised ACLs, allowing users to publish and curate an arbitrary taxonomy of whatever data they choose (be it real-time conversations, history, data streams, files, objects, etc).  This has potential to flip Matrix entirely on its head: Spaces could become the main backbone of the protocol, with chatrooms being mere leaf nodes in a giant tree of collaboration.  Imagine if NNTP, AFS, IRC and the Web had a baby :D  We'll dig into these ideas and more, and their implications for large-scale decentralised open source collaboration in years to come!</p>

      <h2>Grounding this virtual talk</h2>

      <p>In the times of zoom calls, virtual conferencing, and ubiquitous connectivity, I want to take some time and ground myself and this talk on the unceded[1] lands that I am living, working, and recording on as a visitor. I want to acknowledge the Coast Salish people including the səl̓ilwətaɁɬ təməxʷ (Tsleil-Waututh), Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Temíx̱w (Squamish), S’ólh Téméxw (Stó:lō), Stz'uminus, and xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) whose lands were stolen but have rights to these lands even today.</p>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>

      <p>Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, Dimensions, Crossref, Scite.ai, ... What used to be the home turf of for-profit publishers has become a buzzing field of technological innovation. Scholarly metrics, not only limited to citations and altmetrics, come from a host of data providers using an even wider range of technologies to capture and disseminate their data. Citations come as closed or open data, using traditional text processing or AI methods by private corporations, research projects or NGOs. What is missing is a language and standard to talk about the provenance of scholarly metrics.</p>

      <p>In this lightning talk, I will present an argument why we need to pay more attention to the processes of tracing and patterning that go into the creation of the precious data that determine our academic profiles, influence hiring and promotion decitions, and even national funding strategies. Furthmermore, I present an early prototype of Metrics in Context, a data specification for scholarly metrics implemented in Frictionless Data. Additionally, the benefits and application of Metrics in Context is presented using both traditional citation data and a selection of common altmetrics such as the number of Tweets or FB shares.</p>

      <p>The networking stack is one of the most complex and optimized subsystem
      in the Linux kernel, and for a good reason. Between the wild range of
      applications,  the complexity and variety of the networking hardware,
      getting good performances while keeping the stack easily usable from
      userspace has been a long-standing challenge.</p>

      <p>Nowadays, complex Network Interface Controllers (NICs) can be found even
      on small embedded systems, bringing powerful features that were previously
      found only in the server world closest to day to day users.</p>

      <p>This is a good occasion to dive into the Linux Networking stack, to discover
      what is used to make networking as fast as possible, by both using all
      the features of the hardware, but also implementing some clever
      software tricks.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we'll cover these various techniques, ranging from simple
      batch processing with NAPI, queue management with RSS, RPS, XPS and so on,
      flow steering and filtering with ethool and TC, to finish with the newest
      big change that is XDP.</p>

      <p>We'll dive into these various techniques and see how to configure them to
      squeeze the most out of your hardware, and discover that what was
      previously in the realm of datacenters and huge computers can now also
      be appliable to embedded linux development.</p>

      between inputs and outputs.  miniKanren uses a complete interleaving
      search, combined with unification and other constraints, to solve for

    description: |-
      <p>This talk focuses on one specific type of software dependency: bloated dependencies. They are libraries that are packaged with the application's compiled code but that are actually not necessary to build and execute the application. In other words, they are libraries declared as dependencies in a build file, which can be removed from the file and the build still successfully passes. As a consequence of bloated dependencies, the binary file includes more code than necessary. An artificially large binary is an issue when the application is sent over the network (e.g., web applications) or it is deployed on small devices (e.g., embedded systems). In addition, bloated dependencies embed vulnerable code that can be exploited while being actually useless for the application. Overall, bloated dependencies needlessly increase the difficulty of managing and evolving software applications.</p>

      <p>We present our analysis of 9639 Java artifacts hosted on Maven Central, including 723444 dependency relationships. Our key result is as follows: 2,7% of the dependencies directly declared are bloated, 15,4% of the inherited dependencies are bloated, and 57% of the transitive dependencies of the studied artifacts are bloated. Based on these results, we distill and discuss two possible causes: the cascade of unwanted transitive dependencies induced by direct dependencies and the multi-module Maven projects' dependency heritage mechanism.</p>

      <p>Our qualitative assessment of DepClean involves 30 notable open-source projects. For each project, we used DepClean to generate a pom.xml file without bloated dependencies and submitted the changes as a pull request to the project. Notably, our work yielded 21 merged pull requests by open-source developers, and 140 bloated dependencies were removed. In summary, our results indicate that developers pay attention to their dependencies when they are notified of the problem, which stresses the need to engineer, i.e., analyze, maintain, and test POM files.</p>

      collected data, KernelShark and Trace Compass when tracing both baremetal and
      virtualized systems.</p>"
    description: |-
      <p>With tracing, we can get to understand what is really happening while our software is running at a great level of detail. Depending on the adopted tracing solution, that applies to user-space components, to OS kernels or even to both. The collected data can be very helpful when investigating bugs and misbehaviors, but can also be used for understanding the internals of the system and for chasing performance degradations or improvements.</p>

      <p>On Linux, tracing can be done in a variety of ways. This talk will focus on two: ftrace and LTTng. The aim is describing their characteristics and show how each one works. After that we will show what are the main differences between them in terms of what they are capable of, how the are used and last but not least the overhead they introduce, measured with several benchmarks.</p>

      <p>We will also cover the tools that one can use to visualize the often huge amount of data that is usually collected during a tracing session. Both textual ones, such as trace-cmd and babeltrace2, and graphical ones, such as KernelShark and Trace-Compass.</p>

      <p>Last but not least, we will offer some insights on how to use these two mechanisms for tracing virtualized environments. I.e., how can you use them for tracing what is going on both on the host and inside one or more guests, at the same time, and how good are they for such purpose?</p>

    raw_abstract: "<p>Tracing is awesome. Full stop. But what tracing? In fact, even
      just on Linux, there are quite a few tracing solutions, aren't there they? In
      this session we'll show off and compare ftrace and LTTng and, for visualizing
      the collected data, KernelShark and Trace Compass when tracing both baremetal
      and virtualized systems.</p>"
    raw_description: |-
      <p>With tracing, we can get to understand what is really happening while our software is running at a great level of detail. Depending on the adopted tracing solution, that applies to user-space components, to OS kernels or even to both. The collected data can be very helpful when investigating bugs and misbehaviors, but can also be used for understanding the internals of the system and for chasing performance degradations or improvements.</p>

      <p>On Linux, tracing can be done in a variety of ways. This talk will focus on two: ftrace and LTTng. The aim is describing their characteristics and show how each one works. After that we will show what are the main differences between them in terms of what they are capable of, how the are used and last but not least the overhead they introduce, measured with several benchmarks.</p>

      <p>We will also cover the tools that one can use to visualize the often huge amount of data that is usually collected during a tracing session. Both textual ones, such as trace-cmd and babeltrace2, and graphical ones, such as KernelShark and Trace-Compass.</p>

      <p>Last but not least, we will offer some insights on how to use these two mechanisms for tracing virtualized environments. I.e., how can you use them for tracing what is going on both on the host and inside one or more guests, at the same time, and how good are they for such purpose?</p>

      <p>MySQL Group Replication is a solution that implements a fault-tolerant
      database system in which redundant components can be removed
      automatically without compromising the overall system's
      availability. The Asynchronous Replication Connection Failover feature
      complements this by further increasing the resilience of replication
      connections between a replica and a set of sources. It allows
      asynchronous replicas to switch to a new replication source when the
      current connection fails. Therefore, an asynchronous replica can
      automatically switch-over its replication connection to a new member,
      when it is replicating from a Group Replication group, for instance.</p>

      <p>In this session we will present how Asynchronous Replication
      Connection Failover feature automates the process of re-establishing a
      replication connection to another source, upon failure of the current
      one. We will also present about how this feature integrates with
      Group Replication and thus how setting it up can be automated
      as well.</p>

    raw_abstract: "<p>Have you heard of TDD? Are you interested or familiar with this
      practice but have never been able to understand it?</p>\n\n<p>In this session
      I'd like to present the benefits of Test-Driven Development (TDD), explaing
      how it works and what the benefits are of using it. We will see in a more detailed
      approach this way of developing software, where our software is always built
      guided by tests.</p>\n\n<p>We will go over some history about TDD, which is
      the main process we must follow when we work with this mechanic and the rules
      that surround it. We will also list the main advantages and disadvantages that
      most developers who practice TDD find and whether the arguments in favour add
      up to more than those that subtract. Finally, we will review some good habits
      and practices when applying TDD and see how to do it step by step with a Java
      code example.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the session, I hope attendees will have
      a wider understanding of what TDD is, what advantages it brings, why it is interesting
      to master it and also that you will take with you some tricks and good practices
      to be able to apply them in your day-to-day life when writing code \U0001F609</p>"

    description: |-
      <p>Modern component-based systems, in particular microkernels, are impractical.  While it is relatively easy to develop a small microkernel, it is almost impossible to build a component-based environment that can effectively reuse existing components and programs from mainstream systems. The experience of big projects, like Genode, L4Re, rump-kernel, etc. shows that it is an infinite catch-up game when developers try to reproduce POSIX environment and Linux kernel interfaces, while the mainstream systems are constantly evolving.</p>

      <p>In this talk, I will discuss what to do with this infinite loop. I will show, that:</p>

      <ol>
      <li><p>the root cause of the problem is the messaging-based API of component-based systems, which is hardly compatible with POSIX but fundamental</p></li>
      <li><p>a monolithic system can be partitioned without the use of messages but requires some constraints in its design and implementation</p></li>
      <li><p>Modern hardware features like Intel MPK gives new opportunities for kernel developers and allows to resolve some old systems problems.</p></li>
      </ol>


      <p>I will present CubicleOS, a sketch of a LibOS based on Unikraft. CubicleOS does not use messages, works as automatic partitioning system, and turns monolithic Unikraft into a set of isolated components.</p>

      <p>While the coronavirus pandemic continues to send shockwaves throughout almost all industries, it’s important for developers to nurture their communities in a well-efficient way and prepare them for the future. The overwhelmed communication systems, improving remote culture, and fostering community coordination are the three main areas on which we need to focus on. It is important to recognize that community development is an organic process, the listed steps (not in order) are to be considered on how we empower people, communities, and the industries around us:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Learn about the community</li>
      <li>Listen to community members</li>
      <li>Bring people together to develop a shared vision</li>
      <li>Assess community assets and resources, needs and issues</li>
      <li>Help community members to recognize and articulate areas of concern and their causes</li>
      <li>Establish a 'vehicle for change’</li>
      <li>Develop an action plan</li>
      <li>Implement an action plan</li>
      <li>Evaluate the results of actions</li>
      <li>Reflect and regroup</li>
      </ul>


      <p>People want to live in resilient and healthy communities. Well-being and positive mental health start here. Further mental health services need to consider how they harness the assets and strengths of communities in developing approaches that empower people in their recovery journeys.</p>

      <p>Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) system are hardly ever ceaseless as the name would suggest; they do aim though to follow changes in code, configurations and versions.
      They often achieve that by both handling and generating events. For instance, a CD system receives an event that describes a new version of an application, and it runs a workflow in response.
      When the workflow starts or when it reaches completion, the CD system generates events for the benefit of other processes that may want to trigger tests against the newly deployed application version.
      In this short presentation, we introduce the "Events in CI/CD" interest group, part of the Continuous Delivery Foundation, and its mission of standardization and interoperability between CI/CD systems via events.</p>

      <p>The guarantees provided by SPARK, an open-source formal proof tool for Ada, and its analysis are only as strong as the properties that were initially specified. In particular, use of third-party libraries or the Ada standard libraries may weaken the analysis, if the relevant properties of the library API are not specified.
      We progressively added contracts to some of the GCC GNAT Ada standard libraries to enable users to prove additional properties when using them, thus increasing the safety of their programs. In this talk, I will present the different levels of insurance those contracts can provide, from preventing some run-time errors to occur, to describing entirely their action.</p>

    description: |-
      <p>So, let's say that your driver is an immutable OS, like Fedora Silverblue, openSUSE MicroOS, EndlessOS, etc. And let's say you are a power user and/or a developer. So, how do you perform your daily tasks, and how do you do your development on such a system, where you cannot install the compiler for the language you're writing the code in?</p>

      <p>Why, you ask? Well, because immutable OSes are often cleaner, more consistent, more reliable, and a lot harder to break than traditional ones. But that comes at the price of (for instance, on Silverblue and MicroOS) having to reboot several times a day, which is often a showstopper. Unless we leverage containers in order to provide users with a read-write environment that can be easily spawned, and inside which they can "live" and do most of their work (especially if they're doing any development!). This is usually done with something called "toolbox". In fact, Fedora Silverblue has a toolbox. openSUSE MicroOS has a toolbox, which is similar but also different from Silverblue's one. But that's not all of it, e.g., someone came up with podbox and someone else with coretoolbox.</p>

      <p>This talk will show the reasons why having some kind of toolbox is absolutely necessary inside an immutable OS. We will also try to explain the differences between some of the existing approaches and their implementations. And, last but not least, we will showcase --through real-life examples-- how, by taking advantage of a toolbox, you can elect an immutable OS to be the daily driver of your main development workstation, and not have to reboot it (unless you actually want to!)</p>

This is the goal of BabiaXR, a set of front-end modules for 3D and VR (virtual reality) data analysis. The visualization part of BabiaXR is based on A-Frame and Threejs, providing a collection of components for querying data, filtering data, and creating different kinds of visualizations, all of them developed using just front-end technology. Among the visualizations, there are common ones like bar charts, pie charts, bubbles chart, but now we are moving beyond that, exploring new ways of show data in 3D/VR. For example, we are working on representing software projects using the city metaphor, showing the evolution of the project as the evolution of a city, with building corresponding to the different files.
      In this talk, I will do an overview of BabiaXR, showing different examples of the power of WebXR and A-Frame with different visualizations, and how simple is to develop this kind of module using just JavaScript and other front-end libraries. Then, I will analyze a city corresponding to a well-known FOSS project, showing its evolution in different time snapshots and explaining how the code evolves as the city does.</p>

The rapid growth of Object storage means that a growing share of the ecosystem is currently using ad-hoc solutions to leverage this new technology.

      <p>The Serverless computing paradigm facilitates the use of cloud computing resources by developers without the burden of administering and maintaining infrastructure. This simplification of cloud programming appears ideal (in theory) but the catch is that when someone needs to perform a more complex task, things could get a bit more complicated.</p>

      <p>Hardware acceleration, for instance, has been a pain point, even for traditional cloud computing programming models: IaaS providers chose dedicated solutions to avoid interference and preserve tenant isolation (device passthrough), while losing one of the most important benefits of virtualization, flexibility in workload placement through live migration. Various solutions have been proposed to overcome this limitation (API remoting, hardware slicing etc.). In the Serverless world though, do we need users to interface with a hardware device directly?</p>

      <p>Most serverless deployments are backed by containers, however, the most popular (and used) one, AWS Lambda, uses a ligthweight VMM (AWS Firecracker) integrated in the container ecosystem, in order to ensure strict isolation, while maintaining scalability. To this end, enabling hardware acceleration on this kind of deployment incurs the same pain points with traditional cloud infrastructure.</p>

      <p>Kata containers evolved from clear containers and offer hypervisor support for popular orchestrators container deployments such as docker, Kubernetes etc. Through kata containers, AWS Firecracker VMs can be easily provisioned as Pods on a kubernetes system, serving workloads prepared as container images. We build on the kata container runtime and port the necessary components to support vAccel, a lightweight framework for hardware acceleration on VMs, on Firecracker.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we briefly go through vAccel, its design principles and implementation, while focusing on the integration with kata-containers and the end-to-end system applicability on ML inference workloads. We present a short patch for kata-containers to support AWS Firecracker v0.23.1, and go through the necessary patching to add the vAccel framework on k8s. Finally, we present a short demo that scales image classification purpose-built microVMs across a working K8s cluster with GPUs.</p>

      <p>Matrix has traditionally been a decentralised rather than distributed protocol - with conversations replicated over all the servers whose users are participating in that conversation.  However, Matrix clients connect to only one homeserver, which then becomes a central point of control over that account, even though the conversations themselves are decentralised.  P2P Matrix changes everything by making the protocol completely distributed; compiling down the whole server stack to run within the client, and connecting the clients together over a P2P overlay network such as libp2p, Yggdrasil or our new Pinecone overlay.  The approach is particularly nice because the client code doesn't need to change at all: it just connects to a local server rather than a remote one.</p>

      <p>We'll demonstrate the work we've done on our Golang Matrix server implementation, Dendrite, in order to get it robust enough for P2P (which is a great stress test!), explain Pinecone, and give the latest updates on decentralised accounts, privacy preserving relay nodes, and how we'll turn Matrix into a hybrid P2P/client-server network in the future!</p>

      <p>In the ARM world, Secure Boot is typically a BootROM feature, which allows
      for verification of the loaded binaries (firmware, bootloader, Linux kernel)
      prior executing it. The main idea is to prevent the untrusted code from running
      on our platform. The general approach is similar across vendors, but there is
      no standardization in this area.</p>

      <p>During this talk we will review the Secure Boot features in ARM SoCs from some
      of the most popular vendors. Not only will we analyze the Secure Boot presence
      or its features, but we will also focus on the tools and documentation
      availability. It is a known fact that often such documentation requires a
      signed NDA with an SoC vendor, which makes it difficult to use by regular
      users.</p>

      <p>In the ARM world, Secure Boot is typically a BootROM feature, which allows
      for verification of the loaded binaries (firmware, bootloader, Linux kernel)
      prior executing it. The main idea is to prevent the untrusted code from running
      on our platform. The general approach is similar across vendors, but there is
      no standardization in this area.</p>

      <p>During this talk we will review the Secure Boot features in ARM SoCs from some
      of the most popular vendors. Not only will we analyze the Secure Boot presence
      or its features, but we will also focus on the tools and documentation
      availability. It is a known fact that often such documentation requires a
      signed NDA with an SoC vendor, which makes it difficult to use by regular
      users.</p>

      based upon mutual attestation of security-critical software components.</p>"
    description: |-
      <p>A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is a relatively new technology that allows to run an application in a special hardware-protected environment called enclave. Enclaves are cryptographically isolated and protected from the rest of the world, ensuring strong confidentiality and integrity guarantees. Moreover, a mechanism called Remote Attestation is used to obtain a proof that an application running on a remote server is loaded inside an enclave and was not tampered with at loading time. There are several TEEs available in both industry and research worlds, each of them is platform-specific, come with different system footprint, and provide slightly different security guarantees: open-source developments include Sancus and Keystone; proprietary options are, e.g., SGX for Intel processors, SEV for AMD, TrustZone for ARM, etc. Therefore, developing a heterogeneous, distributed application that uses different TEEs is non-trivial for a developer, who needs to adapt the code of each component (or module) to a specific platform. Open-source projects such as Open Enclave SDK and Google Asylo aim to bridge the development gap between different TEEs. However, software engineers still need to account for the communication between different modules, which has to be properly secured with cryptographic operations for data encryption and authentication. After the development phase, a system operator is responsible for deploying this distributed application on the (potentially shared) infrastructure: each module has to be properly initialized and attested (e.g., using Remote Attestation), and connections have to be established (e.g., by creating and distributing session keys). In summary, ensuring strong confidentiality and integrity guarantees in such a situation is difficult and error-prone.</p>

      <p>The framework we are developing automatically handles all of this work: deployment, attestation, configuration, provisioning of communication APIs. Therefore, it provides the developer an abstraction layer in which they only need to implement the application’s logic. The idea behind our implementation is based on the concept of Authentic Execution, which aims to ensure a strong integrity guarantee over the whole execution of an application. The following citation from our previous paper describes the goal of Authentic Execution:</p>

      <p>"Roughly speaking, our notion of authentic execution is the following: if the application produces a physical output event (e.g.,turns on an LED), then there must have happened a sequence of physical input events such that that sequence, when processed by the application (as specified in the high-level source code), produces that output event."
      (from https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~jantobias.muehlberg/stm17/paper.pdf)</p>

      <p>Note that this concept focuses mainly on the integrity of an application: however, confidentiality comes for free in our implementation, thanks to confidential computing provided by the TEEs and authenticated encryption of the data.</p>

      <p>Currently, our framework supports Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone and Sancus (an open-source, embedded TEE for lightweight microcontrollers), allowing the development of applications that can be used in a broad range of use cases, which include cloud processing, mobile devices and lightweight IoT. Our purpose is to provide end-to-end security from low-end systems that include I/O devices to high-end computation nodes. In the presentation, we will demonstrate the use of our framework on the example of a prototypic secure smart irrigation system, a typical use-case for Smart Environments. This example combines SGX and Sancus together to build a secure, heterogeneous system composed of data processing servers and low-power microcontrollers.</p>

      <p>Our work also focuses on code quality, especially in order to ensure absence of memory-corruption vulnerabilities. This is essential for enforcing the security guarantees we are aiming for: TEEs and crypto are not helpful if the code is bugged. Hence, the SGX part of our framework was entirely written in Rust, a modern and fast programming language that provides by nature protection against all low-level memory-corruption vulnerabilities. Work for ARM TrustZone is currently ongoing. We are exploring the use of Rust and C in this implementation as well. Sancus is based on the embedded MSP430 processor with a 16-bit CPU, and therefore its implementation was written in C and assembly. Testing and  verification techniques are to be applied here to ensure the absence of memory-corruption vulnerabilities.</p>

      <p>Our framework aims to minimize the developer’s effort as much as possible: only the application’s logic should be implemented by them, leaving all the details about enclaved execution, secure inter-module communication and Remote Attestation to our framework. To ensure this, the system operator writes a configuration file called deployment descriptor, which includes information about the nodes where the modules will be deployed to, as well as the declaration of connections between two different modules. We implemented a tool that takes as input the source code of all the modules and the deployment descriptor, and it automatically deploys the distributed application according to the information provided in the descriptor. In addition, Remote Attestation is automatically performed to verify the correctness of each module and to exchange session keys for the inter-module communications. Work is in progress to provide complete abstraction over the underlying platform where a module is executed: the ultimate goal is to write an application’s module without having prior knowledge about whether it will be executed on e.g. a SGX or a TrustZone platform. However this is a non-trivial challenge, since two platforms might present huge differences (e.g., Sancus and SGX), and since many features are only available on specific implementations (e.g., Secure I/O).</p>

After the development phase, a system operator is responsible for deploying this distributed application on the (potentially shared) infrastructure: each module has to be properly initialized and attested (e.g., using Remote Attestation), and connections have to be established (e.g., by creating and distributing session keys). In summary, ensuring strong confidentiality and integrity guarantees in such a situation is difficult and error-prone.</p>

      <p>The framework we are developing automatically handles all of this work: deployment, attestation, configuration, provisioning of communication APIs. Therefore, it provides the developer an abstraction layer in which they only need to implement the application’s logic. The idea behind our implementation is based on the concept of Authentic Execution, which aims to ensure a strong integrity guarantee over the whole execution of an application. The following citation from our previous paper describes the goal of Authentic Execution:</p>

      <p>"Roughly speaking, our notion of authentic execution is the following: if the application produces a physical output event (e.g.,turns on an LED), then there must have happened a sequence of physical input events such that that sequence, when processed by the application (as specified in the high-level source code), produces that output event."
      (from https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~jantobias.muehlberg/stm17/paper.pdf)</p>

      <p>Note that this concept focuses mainly on the integrity of an application: however, confidentiality comes for free in our implementation, thanks to confidential computing provided by the TEEs and authenticated encryption of the data.</p>

      <p>Currently, our framework supports Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone and Sancus (an open-source, embedded TEE for lightweight microcontrollers), allowing the development of applications that can be used in a broad range of use cases, which include cloud processing, mobile devices and lightweight IoT. Our purpose is to provide end-to-end security from low-end systems that include I/O devices to high-end computation nodes. In the presentation, we will demonstrate the use of our framework on the example of a prototypic secure smart irrigation system, a typical use-case for Smart Environments. This example combines SGX and Sancus together to build a secure, heterogeneous system composed of data processing servers and low-power microcontrollers.</p>

      <p>Our work also focuses on code quality, especially in order to ensure absence of memory-corruption vulnerabilities. This is essential for enforcing the security guarantees we are aiming for: TEEs and crypto are not helpful if the code is bugged. Hence, the SGX part of our framework was entirely written in Rust, a modern and fast programming language that provides by nature protection against all low-level memory-corruption vulnerabilities. Work for ARM TrustZone is currently ongoing. We are exploring the use of Rust and C in this implementation as well. Sancus is based on the embedded MSP430 processor with a 16-bit CPU, and therefore its implementation was written in C and assembly. Testing and  verification techniques are to be applied here to ensure the absence of memory-corruption vulnerabilities.</p>

      <p>Our framework aims to minimize the developer’s effort as much as possible: only the application’s logic should be implemented by them, leaving all the details about enclaved execution, secure inter-module communication and Remote Attestation to our framework. To ensure this, the system operator writes a configuration file called deployment descriptor, which includes information about the nodes where the modules will be deployed to, as well as the declaration of connections between two different modules. We implemented a tool that takes as input the source code of all the modules and the deployment descriptor, and it automatically deploys the distributed application according to the information provided in the descriptor. In addition, Remote Attestation is automatically performed to verify the correctness of each module and to exchange session keys for the inter-module communications. Work is in progress to provide complete abstraction over the underlying platform where a module is executed: the ultimate goal is to write an application’s module without having prior knowledge about whether it will be executed on e.g. a SGX or a TrustZone platform. However this is a non-trivial challenge, since two platforms might present huge differences (e.g., Sancus and SGX), and since many features are only available on specific implementations (e.g., Secure I/O).</p>

      ensure a smooth continuous delivery experience?</p>"
    raw_description: "<p>Based on our experience at Dailymotion, we'll see why Continuous
      Delivery Indicators are important, how to define them, and then how to collect
      and visualize them. We'll share which stability and throughput indicators we
      are tracking, and why. We'll see how we implemented the collection and visualization
      of these indicators using open-source tools such as Golang, PostgreSQL, and
      Grafana. We'll highlight the importance of Kubernetes-based CD components, such
      as Jenkins X, Lighthouse, and Tekton, which heavily rely on Kubernetes CRD and
      thus provide events for everything happening. We'll also highlight the importance
      of Gitops-based workflows, where every operation goes through a VCS such as
      Git, and thus produce more events. This in turn makes it easy to get notifications
      for all actions, making our indicators collection process a simple one.</p>"

      <p>Continuous Delivery practices have evolved significantly with the cloud-native paradigm. GitOps &amp; Chaos Engineering are at the forefront of this new CD approach, with an ever-increasing pattern involving Git-backed pipeline definitions that implement “chaos stages” in pre-prod environments to gauge service-level objective (SLO) compliance.
      In this talk,  Juergen Etzlstorfer (maintainer of Keptn CNCF project) will discuss how you can construct pipelines that include chaos experimentation (using LitmusChaos) while simulating real-world load, and implement quality gates (based on SLOs) to ensure only resilient applications are deployed into production. He will also demonstrate how you can include chaos tests to your existing CD pipelines without the need of rewriting them.</p>

      <p>Permissionless blockchain environments necessitate the use of a fast and attack-resilient message propagation protocol for Block and Transaction messages to keep nodes synchronised and avoid forks. We present GossipSub, a gossip-based pubsub protocol, which, in contrast to past pubsub protocols, incorporates resilience against a wide spectrum of attacks.</p>

      <p>Firstly, GossipSub's mesh construction implements an eager push model keeps the fan-out of the pubsub delivery low and balances excessive bandwidth consumption and fast message propagation throughout the mesh. Secondly, through gossip dissemination, GossipSub realises a lazy-pull model to reach nodes far-away or outside the mesh. Thirdly, through constant observation, nodes maintain a score profile for the peers they are connected to, allowing them to choose the most well-behaved nodes to include in the mesh. Finally, and most importantly, a number of tailor-made mitigation strategies designed specifically for these three components make GossipSub resilient against the most challenging Sybil-based attacks. We test GossipSub in a testbed environment involving more than 5000 VM nodes deployed on AWS and show that it stays immune to all considered attacks. GossipSub is currently being integrated as the main messaging layer protocol in the Filecoin and the Ethereum 2.0 (ETH2.0) blockchains.</p>

      <p>Have you ever thought to yourself "It would be nice to run this Go HTTP server directly in a browser for demonstration" ? No? Well I have!</p>

      <p>But it's not possible, right? A Go WebAssembly binary <em>can</em> run in browsers, but cannot serve HTTP... Or could it?</p>

      <p>Could we run a Go WebAssembly binary into a browser's ServiceWorker, and serve HTTP from it? Well let's find out!</p>

      <p>IETF is discussing Trusted Execution Environment Provisioning (TEEP) protocol to manage remote installation/update/deletion of a TA (Trusted Application) in TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) which provides hardware isolated environment in the CPU. TEEP is designed to be general among different CPU architectures, but primary implementations are proceeding on Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone. Therefore, we have implemented of TEEP on Keystone which is a TEE project on RISC-V led by UC Berkeley.</p>

      <p>TEEP consists of 3 major software components; “TEEP Broker” on the normal OS, “TEEP Agent” in the TEE, and “Trusted Application Manager (TAM)” on a remote server. These components manage certificates for authenticating TEE and TAM, and code signing of TA. All of the certificates are based on PKI key management. The challenges of having TEEP functionality on RISC-V is how to minimize the complexity of required features of TEEP inside TEE while keeping the portability of existing TA. The TEE is not meant to have full scale of POSIX API development environment which are convenient for developer but not ideal for minimizing security who would like to focus on code size.</p>

      <p>Some of the features we have added to Keystone runtime are HTTP/HTTPS and Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) parser.</p>

      <p>Our initial implementation of TEEP was implemented on Arm TrustZone with OP-TEE and then moved to Keystone on RISC-V. The presentation will also include instruction of basic concept and design of TEEP.</p>

      <p>Nowadays, lots of users are concerned about the safety of their confidential data when it comes to online collaboration. And their concerns are fully justified.</p>

      <p>So we at ONLYOFFICE, an open-source project with the focus on advanced and secure document processing, do our best to provide a comprehensive level of security for online doc editing and collaboration.</p>

      <p>With GDPR compliant ONLYOFFICE Docs, you get a wide range of security tools and services to protect yourself from unauthorized access, data leaks, or insider actions. Self-hosted ONLYOFFICE can be installed on your own private server, so all your data always stays ‘in-house.’ The server level of data protection is implemented, among other things, with JSON Web Token and configurable cache lifetime. Important is, that no user data is stored on the ONLYOFFICE server. Besides, there are additional security features such as restriction on copying, downloading and printing, watermarking, flexible document permissions, etc.</p>

      <p>The same applies to the integration of ONLYOFFICE Docs with other open-source services and platforms so that users of the combined solutions also get secure document editing and co-authoring.</p>

      <p>To make your experience even more secure, last year we implemented:</p>

      <li><p>Custom filter access permission that allows hiding the data you don’t want to show before sharing your spreadsheet. In other words, users won’t be able to change the filter you’ve applied before sharing your spreadsheet and will be able to work only with the specified fields.</p></li>
      <li><p>Storage encryption so that you can protect data at rest against breaches. If the storage encryption option is enabled, all the files stored in your ONLYOFFICE will be encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard, symmetric block cipher, also known as Rijndael, that encrypt data blocks of 128 bits using symmetric keys of 256 bits.</p></li>
      <li><p>The first version of ONLYOFFICE Private Rooms, protected workplaces where every symbol you type is encrypted using the unbreakable AES-256 algorithm, even if you are co-editing documents with your teammates in real-time. Files that are created, stored and shared within a Private Room never leave the directory and cannot be copied, re-distributed, or decrypted. Document encryption and decryption is performed strictly on the user’s machine end-to-end.</p></li>
      </ul>


      <p>Besides, we are now working on multi-functional secure forms for building any document template and secure form filling when your co-author is not permitted to see some parts of the doc.</p>

    raw_abstract: |-
      <p>Nowadays, lots of users are concerned about the safety of their confidential data when it comes to online collaboration. And their concerns are fully justified.</p>

      <p>So we at ONLYOFFICE, an open-source project with the focus on advanced and secure document processing, do our best to provide a comprehensive level of security for online doc editing and collaboration.</p>

      <p>With GDPR compliant ONLYOFFICE Docs, you get a wide range of security tools and services to protect yourself from unauthorized access, data leaks, or insider actions. Self-hosted ONLYOFFICE can be installed on your own private server, so all your data always stays ‘in-house.’ The server level of data protection is implemented, among other things, with JSON Web Token and configurable cache lifetime. Important is, that no user data is stored on the ONLYOFFICE server. Besides, there are additional security features such as restriction on copying, downloading and printing, watermarking, flexible document permissions, etc.</p>

      <p>The same applies to the integration of ONLYOFFICE Docs with other open-source services and platforms so that users of the combined solutions also get secure document editing and co-authoring.</p>

      <p>To make your experience even more secure, last year we implemented:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>Custom filter access permission that allows hiding the data you don’t want to show before sharing your spreadsheet. In other words, users won’t be able to change the filter you’ve applied before sharing your spreadsheet and will be able to work only with the specified fields.</p></li>

If the storage encryption option is enabled, all the files stored in your ONLYOFFICE will be encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard, symmetric block cipher, also known as Rijndael, that encrypt data blocks of 128 bits using symmetric keys of 256 bits.</p></li>

    description: |-
      <p>Component-based operating systems promise the containment of software faults and vulnerabilities by separating functionality into sandboxed components. In practice however, a contained fault is still a fault. Whenever a fault happens in a central server component, clients have to suffer under the outage of the server.</p>

      <p>Device drivers are especially problematic because they tend to be fragile while being a hard dependency for critical software stacks on running on top. Even though a bug in the driver cannot subvert the information security of the dependent components, it cuts the lifelines of those components.</p>

      <p>This fundamental problem calls for an architectural solution. We found the key in the reversal of the dependency relationships for several classes of device drivers. During this line of work, we re-stacked Genode's low-level GUI stack and turned network device drivers into disposable components. Thanks to these changes, drivers for framebuffer, input, network, and wireless devices can now be started, killed, updated, and restarted at anytime without disrupting applications.</p>

      <p>The talk provides a holistic view of Genode's recent architectural changes, gives insights into the though process, outlines the methodology applied for turning big parts of the system upside down, presents limitations, and gives an outlook to the future of Genode and Sculpt OS.</p>

      <p>Join and discover how to build your own embedded Linux system completely from scratch. You will build your own toolchain, bootloader and kernel, that you will run on system with the new Risc-V open Instruction Set Architecture emulated by QEMU. You will also build a minimal root filesystem by yourself thanks to the BusyBox project. You will finish by controlling the system through a tiny webserver. The approach will be to provide only the files that are strictly necessary. That's all the interest of embedded Linux: you can really control and understand everything that runs on your system, and see how simple the system can be. That's much easier than trying to understand how a GNU/Linux system works from a distribution as complex as Debian!</p>

      <p>You will also get details about what's specific to the Risc-V architecture, in particular about the various stages of the boot process. At the end of the presentation, you will leave with all the hardware (!), source code build instructions and demo binaries to reproduce everything by yourself at home, and add your own improvements. Most of the details should also be useful to people using other hardware architectures (in particular arm and arm64).</p>

      <p>This presentation will describe the plan of porting the fwupd daemon to BSD
      distributions (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD). It will explain the
      challenges connected with the implementation of firmware update systems.
      Through the fwupd daemon port, we will extend the functionality of the Linux
      Vendor Firmware Service (LVFS) to another family of systems. I will
      demonstrate the process of porting the fwupd/LVFS, based on the previous
      implementations. Also, I would like to present the fwupd/LVFS chain of trust
      and answer any questions the BSD community may have on this topic. I would love
      to hear some suggestions and feedback, which we should take into account during
      the development process.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The security of the whole system is not determined only by the software it
      runs, but also the firmware. Firmware is a piece of software inseparable from
      the hardware. It is responsible for proper hardware initialization as well as
      its security features. That means that the safety of the machine strongly
      depends on the mitigations of vulnerabilities provided by firmware (like
      microcode updates, bug/exploit fixes). For these particular reasons,
      the firmware should be kept up-to-date.</p>

      <p>Nowadays, one of the most popular firmware update software is fwupd/LVFS.
      fwupd is a Linux daemon that manages firmware updates of each of your hardware
      components that have some kind of firmware. What is more fwupd is open source,
      which makes it more trustworthy than proprietary applications delivered by
      hardware vendors designed for (only) their devices.</p>

    description: |-
      <p>I've been using Perl for more than 25 years, and in fact I started using Travis because it was the only CI/CD tool back then that gave good support to this language. However, over the years I have seen how new tools stopped mentioning it for other languages, notably JavaScript. This meant that, when I needed to write new workflows on base environments, I needed to use shell script and other tools like awk and sed. Which are wonderful tools, but it's almost impossible to be really productive with them.
      Out of curiosity mainly, I started running uname -v and perl --version over the machines where I was bumping my head against shell scripts, and lo and behold, I discovered that, undocumented, Perl was there. That started a quest for creating pull requests all over the place so that its presence is documented... And also a series of initiatives to actually put it down to use.</p>

      <p>Baseline is: since Perl is already present in the environments used to run workflows, you can save precious seconds of language installation, and you can actually perform some serious data munging and processing using the base configuration. We will show different examples of this in different environments, and also some ways to speed up even more your workflows to save those precious seconds that are in such short supply in the free tier lately.</p>

    abstract: "<p>Existing attestation schemes require pre-signed enclave images and
      provide few means of including runtime-dependent configuration data (like report
      data, enclave held data, configid). In multi-party settings in which the parties
      may not always fully trust each other, attestation of multiple pieces of code
      or data images via these means is cumbersome and inefficient. For example, consider
      the case of a secure cloud service running a JavaScript interpreter, which interprets
      a third-party script, in which case both, the interpreter and the script, can
      interfere with each other's attestation evidence as they share an address space.
      Similarly, a group of users may want to compute a shared result over all of
      their combined data, but without sharing their data with each other. Attestation
      in such scenarios is greatly simplified by a technique called Extended Enclave
      Initialization Data (EEID), which provides a secure and convenient means to
      combine all required attestation evidence, and to automatically re-sign images
      (with a well known service key) during enclave startup to ensure that all of
      the code and data is loaded and attested appropriately. An added benefit is
      that even single-party applications can use this technique to automatically
      re-sign enclave images with modified configuration settings (like memory size
      and thread count), independent of, or in addition to, underlying TEE support
      for configuration changes. EEID is currently available as an experimental feature
      for SGX enclaves in the Open Enclave SDK and it is used in multiple prototype
      services at Microsoft.</p>"

    raw_abstract: "<p>Existing attestation schemes require pre-signed enclave images
      and provide few means of including runtime-dependent configuration data (like
      report data, enclave held data, configid). In multi-party settings in which
      the parties may not always fully trust each other, attestation of multiple pieces
      of code or data images via these means is cumbersome and inefficient. For example,
      consider the case of a secure cloud service running a JavaScript interpreter,
      which interprets a third-party script, in which case both, the interpreter and
      the script, can interfere with each other's attestation evidence as they share
      an address space. Similarly, a group of users may want to compute a shared result
      over all of their combined data, but without sharing their data with each other.
      Attestation in such scenarios is greatly simplified by a technique called Extended
      Enclave Initialization Data (EEID), which provides a secure and convenient means
      to combine all required attestation evidence, and to automatically re-sign images
      (with a well known service key) during enclave startup to ensure that all of
      the code and data is loaded and attested appropriately. An added benefit is
      that even single-party applications can use this technique to automatically
      re-sign enclave images with modified configuration settings (like memory size
      and thread count), independent of, or in addition to, underlying TEE support
      for configuration changes. EEID is currently available as an experimental feature
      for SGX enclaves in the Open Enclave SDK and it is used in multiple prototype
      services at Microsoft.</p>"

      <p>Estimating the user's mental state with a set of special measuring devices can be helpful in detecting bottlenecks of the human-computer interaction. Until recent years, electroencephalography devices were too expensive and too complicated for most UX researchers, but now there are affordable consumer-grade EEG devices.</p>

      <p>The talk covers EEG headsets produced by NeuroSky and Emotiv, as well as the open hardware OpenBCI project. Each headset has its advantages and disadvantages for UI/UX research. Commercial devices have different primary goals complicating their usage for research with cyphering, special licenses and limitations in the vendor-provided proprietary SDKs - but open-source tools developed by the community improve the situation. OpenBCI is quite the opposite: it is fully open, but much harder to obtain/build.</p>

      <p>Specifics of data that can be acquired from each headset is reviewed, and existing open-source tools and libraries to get these data are discussed. The talk explains how we can use each headset to get information about the user's mental state. Mind concentration or relaxation is a highly informative parameter for UX; it can be easily evaluated and it can be obtained with any of the EEG headsets.

      <p>Estimating the user's mental state with a set of special measuring devices can be helpful in detecting bottlenecks of the human-computer interaction. Until recent years, electroencephalography devices were too expensive and too complicated for most UX researchers, but now there are affordable consumer-grade EEG devices.</p>

      <p>The talk covers EEG headsets produced by NeuroSky and Emotiv, as well as the open hardware OpenBCI project. Each headset has its advantages and disadvantages for UI/UX research. Specifics of data that can be acquired from each headset is reviewed, and existing open-source tools and libraries to get these data are discussed. The talk explains how we can use EEG headsets to evaluate mind concentration and relaxation, as well as rejection and arousal factors, which can be used to detect positive and negative emotions.

      <p>Estimating the user's mental state with a set of special measuring devices can be helpful in detecting bottlenecks of the human-computer interaction. Until recent years, electroencephalography devices were too expensive and too complicated for most UX researchers, but now there are affordable consumer-grade EEG devices.</p>

      <p>The talk covers EEG headsets produced by NeuroSky and Emotiv, as well as the open hardware OpenBCI project. Each headset has its advantages and disadvantages for UI/UX research. Commercial devices have different primary goals complicating their usage for research with cyphering, special licenses and limitations in the vendor-provided proprietary SDKs - but open-source tools developed by the community improve the situation. OpenBCI is quite the opposite: it is fully open, but much harder to obtain/build.</p>

      <p>Specifics of data that can be acquired from each headset is reviewed, and existing open-source tools and libraries to get these data are discussed. The talk explains how we can use each headset to get information about the user's mental state. Mind concentration or relaxation is a highly informative parameter for UX; it can be easily evaluated and it can be obtained with any of the EEG headsets. Besides that, most of the reviewed devices provide enough data to measure rejection and arousal factors, which can be used to detect positive and negative emotions. Finally, EEG usage scenarios with examples of the FLOSS projects exposed to such UI testing are discussed.</p>

We don't have infinite time, but we can talk about the most common ones, and go through a step-by-step process in how to diagnose them, repair them, and bring the system back up in record time. A careful and methodical approach is essential to not making a bad situation worse, and getting the database back on all four feet quickly.</p>

      <p>We are convinced that young people can make an important contribution to the Free Software community. They see many things from a different perspective than adults, which is worth looking at more closely, because new ideas and points of view can be integrated into the development of free software. Since most children and young people are already in contact with the digital world at school, we want to involve young people in the development of software.
      In our presentation, we will show how we include the youth into the free software community with the schul-frei project. It shows educational establishments the advantages of free software and presents solutions they could use. The goals of the project are not to offer only software. It allows for example students and teachers to develop apps together for their school, which can be integrated into the running system we present.</p>

      <p>Teckids e.V. is a German association which provides a legal frame for three technological projects.
      We manage the project called "schul-frei", which aims to bring digitisation with free software to schools. We especially value the participation of youth in these projects, because they are the people which are affected by digitisation the most. Our educational concept is also based around the idea that young people should be judged by their abilities, not by age. They should learn to take responsibility and be independent.
      An example of this would be the AlekSIS project. It is (mostly) developed by adolescents from Teckids e.V. and from the school Katharineum zu Luebeck, where it is actively used. AlekSIS is a web-based school information system which can be used to manage and/or publish organisational subjects of educational institutions. It is also part of the schul-frei canon and uses the EUPL.
      We also present and provide support for solutions such as Moodle or BigBlueButton for E-Learning and debianedu/skolelinux with Nextcloud for school networks on our website https://schul-frei.org/en/index.html
      We set up comprehensive platforms for schools, education and youth institutions in time for the increased demand for online teaching. This has contributed to the fact that more education providers are interested in these solutions and that the various projects are gaining in reach</p>

      <p>Recently proposed domain-specific systems-on-chip (DSSoCs) optimize the architecture, computing resources, and run-time management by exploiting the application characteristics for a given domain. As such, DSSoCs can boost the performance and energy-efficiency of software-defined radio (SDR) applications without degrading their flexibility.
      Harvesting the full potential of DSSoCs depends critically on integrating an optimal combination of computing resources and their effective runtime utilization. For this reason, the design space exploration process requires evaluation frameworks to guide the design process. Full-system simulators, such as gem5, can perform instruction-level cycle-accurate simulation. However, this level of detail leads to long execution times and is beyond high-level design space exploration requirements. In contrast, hardware emulation using Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) prototypes are substantially faster. However, they involve significantly higher development effort to implement the target SoC and applications. Given the design complexity, there is a strong need for a simulation environment that enables rapid, high-level, simultaneous exploration of scheduling algorithms and power-thermal management techniques.
      To this end, we present DS3, an open-source system-level domain-specific system-on-chip simulation framework that targets SDR applications. DS3 framework enables (1) run-time scheduling algorithm development, (2) dynamic thermal-power management (DTPM) policy design, and (3) rapid design space exploration. DS3 facilitates plug-and-play simulation of scheduling algorithms; it also incorporates built-in heuristics and a constraint programming-based scheduler to provide an upper bound of performance (i.e., optimal schedule for a set of applications and an SoC configuration) for users. Hence, it can be used to develop and evaluate new schedulers that can be integrated into GNU Radio. DS3 also includes power dissipation and thermal models that enable users to design and evaluate new DTPM policies. Furthermore, it features built-in dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) governors deployed on commercial SoCs.
      In this talk as we discuss the DS3 capabilities, we will present a benchmark application suite with applications from wireless communications and radar processing domains including WiFi TX/RX, low-power single-carrier TX/RX, range detection, and pulse Doppler. We will conclude the talk with design-space exploration studies using these applications.</p>

      <p>MoveTK is a reusable, well tested, high performant, feature-rich library that incorporates state of the art algorithms for computational movement analysis. The library is designed to be extensible such that it can be adapted for various movement analysis tasks. The library has been developed as part of a collaboration between HERE Technologies, Eindhoven University of Technology and Utrecht University under the Commit2Data program.</p>

      <p>This talk is intended to showcase the scalability of MoveTK to large geo-spatial data sets. Moreover, through visualisations, we will demonstrate the various movement analysis algorithms that are available in MoveTK. Any scalable movement analysis task can be based on three fundamental building blocks: (a) the representation of (geo-)spatial movement data (b) the shape and specifically geometric aspect of movement and (c) algorithms that have theoretical bounds on their time and space complexity. Therefore, we will present the design decisions adopted in MoveTK, that allows seamless interoperability between these fundamental building blocks.</p>

      <p>Ceph is an open source, highly scalable, software defined storage that provides object, file and block interfaces under a unified system.
      Ceph Object Storage Gateway (RGW) provides a RESTful object storage interface to the Ceph Storage cluster. It provides an interface that is compatible with a large subset of AWS S3 APIs.
      In this talk we will discuss the upcoming features in ‘Pacific’ release and beyond. The list of features are:
      S3select
      Lua scripting
      Encryption - kmip, kms backend, sse-s3
      D3n cache
      Gc OMAP offload
      Xattrs in nfs
      Hadoop connector that uses rgw
      Bucket notifications: addition of persistent bucket notifications
      Zypper
      multisite enhancements</p>

      Ceph Object Storage Gateway (RGW) provides a RESTful object storage interface to the Ceph Storage cluster. It provides an interface that is compatible with a large subset of AWS S3 APIs.
      In this talk we will discuss the upcoming features in ‘Pacific’ release and beyond. The list of features are:
      S3select
      Lua scripting
      Encryption - kmip, kms backend, sse-s3
      D3n cache
      Gc OMAP offload
      Xattrs in nfs
      Hadoop connector that uses rgw
      Bucket notifications: addition of persistent bucket notifications
      Zypper
      multisite enhancements</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://profiler.firefox.com/">Firefox Profiler</a> is a profiler that is built into Firefox. It has tighter integration with Firefox than external profilers. With its special annotations on Firefox's source code, it tells you what's happening at a point in time on your JavaScript code. With various measurements, it can provide more information and insight into your web application.</p>

      <p>During the talk, I will be briefly explaining the profilers, how to capture a good profile and how to analyze the profile data. I will be sharing Firefox Profiler specific features and how to make the best use of them. In the end of the slides, I will be doing a demo on how to analyze a performance problem.</p>

      <p>A profiler is a tool that monitors the execution of an application and gathers the data about the program execution in that time frame. Using a profiling tool to look at problems can make it a lot easier to figure out what’s going on in the application. It helps you to get detailed information about the execution of your application and it allows you to understand the behavior of it.</p>

      <p>At Mozilla, we are working hard to make the Firefox Profiler better for web developers. In Firefox, we are replacing the old performance panel inside the Developer Tools with Firefox Profiler so people can fully utilize all the new features that come with Firefox Profiler. We are both happy and excited to share more about this tool!</p>

      <p>Want the smallest setup with fully redundant storage, networking and compute that's capable of running both containers and virtual machines?
      Well, this is it. This talk will go over the journey of building a 3 nodes redundant cluster meant to host public web services.</p>

      <p>The setup boils down to Ceph for storage, OVN for networking, LXD for compute/management and some fancy BGP networking for external network redundancy. All of that running on 3 identical machines bought on eBay and some reasonable SSD/HDD bought new.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Finding cloud computing a bit too expensive for your taste?
      Whether it's because of storage, network or compute costs, the convenience of having instances running within seconds can easily be outweighed by the bill at the end of the month.</p>

      <p>In this case, cloud hosting already wasn't an option and instead renting dedicated servers from the likes of Hetzner and OVH was done.
      This is already a lot more affordable but gets problematic when you'd like a cluster of them as fast interconnect between rental servers is uncommon and/or gets expensive quite quickly.</p>

      <p>So wanting to move from standalone servers to a small redundant cluster, the only option that made financial sense ended up going with buying servers and finding a local co-location facility to host them. Not wanting to have to pay on-site staff or go onsite whenever something fails, the setup is quite focused on resiliency, allowing for the loss of an entire server or the loss of components from many servers without significant impact on the cluster.</p>

      <p>The end result is effectively a tiny personal cloud, capable of running most common workloads, running on used server hardware in a colo facility with an estimated price per month, assuming a 5 years lifespan on the hardware roughly equivalent to renting just two reasonably sized machines from a dedicated server provider.</p>

I will also introduce Discord.py, a python library that offered an async API to let you build a Discord bot. This will give the audiences a background about the following quick demo and explanation of a simple bot that I built.</p>

      <p>In the second part of the talk, I will walk through how to build a bot for registering attendees for EuroPython. Following a quick demo, I will also give a walkthrough about some of the async coroutines available in Discord.py: event listener like on_ready and commands. I will also explain how the async code is different from the sync code and the danger of mixing them together.</p>

      <p>Hopefully, audiences will be inspired to build their own bot and learn a little bit about writing async code in Python and using Discord.py. This talk is suitable for attendees who got basic knowledge in Python but not necessarily know about Discord or async.</p>

      <p>WebPageTest is one of the most well known and important tools in the web performance community. It's been actively developed by Pat Meenan since he worked at AOL in 2008. It has become the go to tool for both very simple to very advanced debugging of the web performance of a website. One of its most well known charts is the waterfall chart. In this talk I'm going to introduce the waterfall chart and also go into detail on how you can examine and read it. The more you understand about the chart, the the more WebPageTest as a whole will be able to help you fix a slow performing website.</p>

      <p>In the PostgreSQL core, we have the SPGiST index, which is more lightweight and significantly faster than GiST for the supported data types. In many cases, it is the most suitable option for geometric data like points, boxes, etc. An easy way to increase the selection speed is to eliminate the need for the results recheck by a table. But with the index being single-column by design we could not enjoy index-only scans for multicolumn queries.</p>

      <p>The talk covers my improvement of the SPGiST access method. Non-key columns can now be included in a single key-column index in a way, similar to that have in GiST and B-tree. This adds the ability to make fast index-only scans for multicolumn queries. Also, non-key columns with data types without SPGiST opclass can be added, which creates an opportunity for the new use cases. In my presentation, I will justify the modification, discuss new use cases of GiST and SPGiST indexes, and share some performance benchmarks.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>Using software with known vulnerabilities is one of OWASP’s Top 10 security vulnerabilities . This is increasingly becoming more important as more and more software is built on top of existing free and open source software. From the perspective of software composition analysis, it then becomes increasingly important to know about vulnerable components being used. Naturally a database of mappings of packages and their vulnerabilities is required. Below are some of the problems with existing solutions and how VulnerableCode solves these.</p>

      <h1>The CPE problem :-</h1>

      <p>The National Vulnerability Database by the US government uses CPE data format to map vulnerabilities to affected components. CPEs were invented before the mass the adoption of FOSS software, and has a vendor centric design. CPEs hence are ineffective in mapping vulnerabilities to FOSS packages, because of it’s distributed nature and distribution in form of different packaging systems.</p>

      <p>VulnerableCode instead of CPEs uses package urls to map vulnerabilities and packages. Package URLs is a data format undergoing rapid adoption, it was designed at ScanCode for representing packages from different ecosystems.</p>

      <h1>The License problem:-</h1>

      <p>Majority of remaining solutions are commercial vulnerability databases. This is a problem because
      Data about vulnerabilities affecting FOSS must also be free and open source. Having such data behind paywall limits usage of FOSS .
      Commercial vulnerability databases have an incentive to bloat the data, to outshine their competition. Since the data is not open, auditing for fake vulnerabilities is also not possible.</p>

      <p>VulnerableCode has a libre license and the data is fully open sourced, this prevents (1). Bloating the data is not an option since due to the open source nature of the project, the data is always available for public scrutiny.</p>

      <h1>The Data problem:-</h1>

      <p>Almost every major FOSS distributor provides some sort of public disclosure of vulnerabilities. They use different data formats to do so, some use variants of machine readable formats with diverse schemas, others rely on only  providing  human readable vulnerability disclosures.
      This reduces the usability of such data in SCA tools.</p>

      <p>VulnerableCode instead parses and converts data from such sources into one single package url based data format. This allows other SCA tools to easily leverage it. The open source nature of project also allows community curation thus the data can be further enriched and purified by the community</p>

      <p>File ownership is a global property on most systems that have a uid and gid concept. On POSIXy systems the chown*() syscall family allows to change the owner of a file or directory.
      If the ownership of a file is changed it will be changed for each user on the systems equally.
      But various use-cases exist where this can be problematic:
      - Portable home directories that are used on different computers where the user is assigned a different uid and gid.
      - Filesystems that allow to merge or unionize multiple filesystems are often shared between different users.
      - On Linux user namespaces used in containers also affect file ownership.
      - Chowning files on really large filesystems is costly.
      Idmapped mounts solve these problems and others by allow bind-mounts to specify idmappings allowing to change file ownership on a per-mount point basis.
      In this talk we will take a close look technical at the idmapped mount patchset, the use-cases it is intended to solve, and we will demo it's capabilities.</p>

      <p>With the global pandemic, many teams have turned to remote work on a full-time basis. Prior, the XWiki team had been working distributively, building open-source software, for over 15 years. Some of us were working remotely full time. Other colleagues opted to go to the office. The majority of the team chose to blend the two, depending on their preferences and needs. Almost a year on, what seemed a temporary change feels like a permanent arrangement.</p>

      <p>Being able to work entirely remotely has been, in many ways, a privilege. But collaborating during a pandemic is not business as usual. This talk reflects on the specific challenges we faced, the changes and tools we implemented to address them, and the ways we tried to support each other through this uncertain period. While there’s no one size fits all, we hope sharing our experience will prove useful for teams navigating similar challenges. We’re in this together.</p>

      <p>PostgreSQL is well-known for its extensibility. One can create their own types, operators, access methods, etc. or use powerful PL/pgSQL language to write functions, extensions, and so on and so on. Everything is thoroughly documented, supported and ready to use. However, there is also a very intimate extensibility layer, which allows external developers to peek right into the PostgreSQL core — hooks. For some reason this topic is not covered enough by official documentation.</p>

      <p>First, this talk will focus on which core hooks do exist, which options they provide for potential developers, and which PostgreSQL extensions get use of them to achieve an additional out-of-core functionality.</p>

      <p>Next part will show an example of how one can consistently distribute some DDL across multiple PostgreSQL instances. This is based on experience got from Postgres Professional's take on sharded Postgres (first alpha version of <code>shardman</code> extension is available <a href="https://github.com/postgrespro/shardman">here</a>).</p>

      <p>Finally, there will be demonstrated a tricky way to extend CREATE TABLE syntax using PostgreSQL hooks without even touching the core. So one was able to do, e.g.:</p>

      <pre><code>CREATE TABLE users (
        id      int not null,
        name    text
      ) WITH (distributed_by = 'id',
              num_parts = 12,
              colocate_with = 'companies');

      <p>When someone starts learning about classes in Python, one of the first things they'll come across is "self" in the parameter list of a method. To keep it simple, it's usually explained that Python will automatically pass the current instance as the first argument to the method: "self" will refer to the instance the method was called on. This high-level explanation really helps with keeping the focus on learning the basics of classes, but it also side-steps what is really going on: It makes it sound like process of inserting "self" is something <strong>automagical</strong> that the language just does for you. In reality, the mechanism behind inserting self isn't magical at all and it's something you can very much play with yourself.</p>

      <p>In this intermediate level talk, Sebastiaan Zeeff will take you down into the heart of the Python data model to explain how the mechanism behind inserting "self" works. He will talk about the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#descriptors">descriptor protocol</a> and how it allows you to modify how attributes are accessed, assigned, or deleted in Python. He hopes that understanding how descriptors work will demystify "self" in Python.</p>

      <p>Iaso is a platform created to support geo-rich data collection efforts, mainly in public health in emerging countries. The key feature that it supports is that any survey is linked to an organizational unit that is part of a canonical hierarchy. Each one of these org units can have a location and a territory. The mobile data collection tool can be used to enrich this hierarchy with additional GPS coordinates, names corrections, etc ... which can then be validated by officials of the organizations in question through the web dashboard. This leads to continuous improvements of the geographic references available through the routines activities already planned (e.g. locating and registering health facilities while investigating malaria cases).</p>

      <p>The tool has been used in multiple data collection efforts, notably in the domain of Performance Based Financing of health services in D.R. Congo, Niger, Cameroon and Nigeria and is more and more used to compare multiple version of official oranizational hierarchies when a canonical one needs to be rebuilt. We are for example working on such efforts to rebuild a school map for DRC with the NGO Cordaid. To help for this type of project, we provide location selection interfaces, multiple levels of audits and an API open to data scientists for analysis and mass edits.</p>

      <p>This presentation will demo the main features of the platform, and give some context about its creation.</p>

      <p>Iaso has been created by the company Bluesquare (https://bluesquarehub.com/, based in Belgium), specialised in software and services for public health, and has become open source under the MIT License in November 2020.</p>

      <p>It is still under heavy development, but is already the basis of at least a dozen projects. On the roadmap, we have features for a patient registry, monitoring tools for data collectors, and microplanning activities (producing routes for monitoring teams). It is also extensively used in connection with DHIS2, the open source Data For Health Information System.</p>

      <p>Iaso is made of a white labeled Android application using Java/Kotlin and reusing large parts of the ODK projects and a web platform programmed using Python/GeoDjango on top of PostGIS. Frontend is mainly React/Leaflet. One of the aims is the ease of integration with other platforms. We already have csv and geopackage imports and exports and target easy integration with OSM.</p>

      <p>We made the Web accessible to human. What about making the web (of data)
      accessible to computers?
      Publish open data could be struggling. Deposit a CSV file on a web server is not enough. The data model used should be explicitly defined.</p>

      <p>The Linked Open Data (https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data) solves this with:
      * standardized implementation format (RDF)
      * standardized data access (Content negociation, SPARQL endpoint)
      * standardized data indentification (URI, data model as data)</p>

      <p>For example all the data from the Bibliothèque National de France (national library of France) are widely accessible by using these standards.
      This allowed the development of data federation initiatives, such as Europeana (https://www.europeana.eu).</p>

      <p>CubicWeb is a semantic web application framework, licensed under the LGPL,
      that follows Linked Open Data best practices.
      During this presentation we will discuss about Linked Open Data benefits,
      and how CubicWeb could be used as a "on shelve" framework to do so.</p>

      that follows Linked Open Data best practices.
      During this presentation we will discuss about Linked Open Data benefits,
      and how CubicWeb could be used as a "on shelve" framework to do so.</p>

      <p>The story about a challenging PoC that proved that Postgres can achieve the same performance as Oracle Exadata. The schema that was migrated wasn’t the simplest one you might see. It was quite the opposite. The code was loaded with dynamic queries, BULK COLLECT’s, nested loops, CONNECT BY statements, global variables and lot of dependencies. Ora2pg did a great job converting the schema but left a lot of work to do manually. Also estimates produced by the tool were highly inaccurate since the logic required not the migration but total re-architecture of the code.

      <p>How do you monitor Postgres? What information can you get out of it, and to what degree does this information help to troubleshoot operational issues? What if you want/need to log all the queries? That may bring heavy trafficked databases down.</p>

      <p>At OnGres we’re obsessed with improving PostgreSQL’s observability. So we worked together with Tetrate folks on an Envoy’s Network Filter extension for PostgreSQL, to provide and extend observability of the traffic inout a cluster infrastructure. This extension is public and open source. You can use it anywhere you use Envoy. It allows you to capture automated metrics and to debug network traffic. This talk will be a technical deep-dive into PostgreSQL’s protocol decoding, Envoy proxy filters and will cover all the capabilities of the tool and its usage and deployment in any environment.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Envoy [1] is a high performance C++ distributed proxy designed for single services and applications, as well as a communication bus and “universal data plane” designed for large microservice “service mesh” architectures. Built on the learnings of solutions such as NGINX, HAProxy, hardware load balancers, and cloud load balancers, Envoy runs alongside every application and abstracts the network by providing common features in a platform-agnostic manner. When all service traffic in an infrastructure flows via an Envoy mesh, it becomes easy to visualize problem areas via consistent observability, tune overall performance, and add substrate features in a single place.</p>

      <p>Envoy can be used to proxy connections to PostgreSQL instances and in this talk we’ll see how we improve PostgreSQL observability without impacting the performance of the database and without needing to install and/or configure a bunch of things like logs, pg<em>stat</em>statements, etc, using a Network Filter [2] for PostgreSQL we developed that decodes frontend and backend protocol to get transparently some metrics and metadata about it operation.</p>

      <p>Roadmap:
      - [WIP] SSL termination and monitoring [3] [4]
      - Integrate Postgres parser to improve dynamic metadata and per-query tracking
      - Individual (per-query) tracking of query performance
      - Traffic mirroring for Postgres major upgrade testing and validations</p>

This presentation attempts to vindicate the value of ENUM, the underdog of the data types.</p>

      <p>On this talk you'll learn:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Advantages and disadvantages of the ENUM types</li>
      <li>How to use ENUM in your database schema design</li>
      <li>Using ordering of ENUM values</li>
      <li>Casting ENUM data types</li>
      <li>Manipulating ENUM data types</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Disaggregated computing today relies more on add-in-cards like FPGAs/Smart NICs/xPUs. Traditionally add-in-cards have relied on IPMI based manageability solutions. However, the newer standards from DMTF (PMCI protocol stack) provide more robust and scalable solutions for add-in card manageability.
      SPDM provides the attestation and secure communication channel between the BMC and the add-in cards. MCTP/PLDM stack provides mechanisms for the BMC to auto discover card’s capabilities and carry out manageability functions like sensor monitoring, event logging, firmware updates etc. This provides significant advantage over IPMI which lacked secure communications and had limitations on supporting advanced high speed interfaces like PCIe and had limitations on number of sensors it could support.</p>

      <p>We plan to present on how add-in-cards can be managed through PMCI protocols and how do we model the add-in-cards’ manageability functions in a way a DataCentre orchestration software can consume it (i.e. Redfish modelling  of add-in-cards). The implementation is planned for OpenBMC and a variety of Add-In-Cards can be supported through a standard manageability model.</p>

      <p>Query optimizer is one of the key components which determines DBMS performance under OLAP workload. Nevertheless, it was shown that query optimizer often fails to find a good execution plan because of incorrect cardinality estimations.
      The perspective approach to improve cardinality estimation quality is adaptive query optimization. In contrast with classical approaches, which rely on the precomputed histograms, it utilizes the execution statistics of the previously executed queries to refine cardinality estimations. However, the original AQO uses a modification of kNN machine learning method, which implies a number of limitations on the AQO applicability.
      In the current lecture we will make an introduction to the kNN-based AQO. Afterwards, we will present you our novel neural network-based AQO which can potentially overcome the limitations of the kNN-based AQO, and will demonstrate the first experimental results.</p>

      <p>Have you ever had issues to share your Jupyter Notebooks? Ever had troubles with code that "works on my machine" only? Do you consider your Research and Development smooth and straightforward? Is your code scalable? Tough questions, I know.

      <p>As part of the schul-frei project of Teckids e.V. we curate free software and offer it to educational institutions. Besides the general equipment of schools with free software, an equal involvement of students in the development is for us important. One of the solutions presented by the project schul-frei is AlekSIS, a web-based school information system that is being developed jointly by Teckids e.V. and students of the Katharineum in Lübeck. The django-based platform provides data structures that can be used by separately developed apps. The special feature of this project compared to other information systems is that apps can be developed that cover specific application areas of a school. AlekSIS is a framework for apps that can be developed together with students in computer science classes, for example, because the development of such apps with python is easy to follow.
      Since AlekSIS is just a part of the free software curation, it can be excellently combined with other services or network accounts that are used in school.
      In our talk we will show, how this framework concretely looks like and how people can contribute to this project or use this system, for example at schools.</p>

      <p>Eleventy gained the hearts of the community by storm.
      But what makes it compelling?</p>

      <p>This talk will show you how to get started, choose a template language, pull in data from an API and deploy the results to Netlify using GitHub Actions.
      It is not only suited to blogs, but also for conference websites or business outlets.</p>

      <p>You can pick from Liquid, Nunjucks, Haml, Pug, EJS, Handlebars or Mustache or go with plain JavaScript template strings.
      Data Directories allow for abstracting away recurring frontmatter elements. They can even be leveraged to build entire pages from!
      Also, you can query an API endpoint and provide the results as Data to your templates.</p>

      <p>The build and deploy process can happen whereever you like. For this demo, I'm going to use GitHub Pages and Netlify.</p>

      <p>The finish up will be a showcase of different real-life examples from the community to inspire you.</p>

      But it gets amazing feedback from different parties.
      Time to look into what makes it so compelling!
      We'll touch Setup, Data Directory Files and Template Languages.
      You'll see, that you have plenty of options to choose from.</p>

      <p>Eleventy gained the hearts of the community by storm.
      But what makes it compelling?</p>

      <p>This talk will show you how to get started, choose a template language, pull in data from an API and deploy the results to Netlify using GitHub Actions.
      It is not only suited to blogs, but also for conference websites or business outlets.</p>

      <p>You can pick from Liquid, Nunjucks, Haml, Pug, EJS, Handlebars or Mustache or go with plain JavaScript template strings.
      Data Directories allow for abstracting away recurring frontmatter elements. They can even be leveraged to build entire pages from!
      Also, you can query an API endpoint and provide the results as Data to your templates.</p>

      <p>The build and deploy process can happen whereever you like. For this demo, I'm going to use GitHub Pages and Netlify.</p>

      <p>The finish up will be a showcase of different real-life examples from the community to inspire you.</p>

      <p>For years now, we associate Responsive Web Design with Media Queries which adapt to the width of the device we are using.
      But what if we can take this one step further?
      Modern devices are brimful of sensors. The fun thing? There are JavaScript and CSS APIs which allow access to some of them!
      This talk will introduce you to some lesser known Web APIs and give examples on how you can progressively enhance your design with sensor input!</p>

      <p>When I did some research for hackathons, I noticed on MDN Web Docs, that there are APIs for device sensors, that rarely get used.</p>

      <p>The devicemotion and deviceorientation API might be known from Firefox OS days.
      But you can also use Ambient Light, Voice, Colours, Pointer devices, NFC or Bluetooth - if the device supports it.</p>

      <p>This talk is using a Fairphone 3+ as mobile device to demonstrate some of those APIs.
      Part of them are available on Firefox, others on Chrome. You might need to toggle some flags to enable them.
      This means, it's not production ready yet - but you can build interesting demos to convince browser vendors to refine the APIs for production!</p>

      <p>An idea might be to adjust the contrast or font to the environment you are.
      Or the position you are in.
      Or the devices which could be detected around you.</p>

      <p>In order to ensure that MariaDB runs smoothly, it needs to be tested on multiple platforms and configurations. In order to obtain a gain both in terms of speed and flexibility, we have decided to use Docker latent workers. In this way, each different environment is defined in a separate dockerfile. Besides having a clean and concise environment definition, using latent workers has the advantage of requiring minimal configurations on the worker machines. This makes the process of adding new hardware very easy, mainly involving installing Docker and configuring Docker remote access.</p>

      <p>Now that we have the build environments defined, we can start testing. The process starts by cloning the MariaDB server repo and creating a source tarball. Then, all other configurations are triggered, all using the same source tarball.</p>

      <p>While it seemed quite straightforward, the whole process turned out to be more challenging than we expected. This includes a quite long list of issues ranging from files mixups, weird sporadic failures where the main testing process was killed, grid view customizations to multi-master configuration and master-worker file transfer problems. In this talk, I will talk in more detail about these issues and tell you more about our experience and how we managed to overcome them.</p>

      <p>Applications demand fast and secure execution in diverse environments (Cloud
      data centers, Edge Nodes, mobile platforms etc.). Execution efficiency has been
      facilitated by the introduction of specialized compute elements (eg. GPUs), in
      order to accelerate specific parts of tasks/workloads (such is image
      processing). At the same time, too abstract deployment and
      management burdens, service providers use virtualization and container
      technologies. Eliminating the software overheads of these abstractions,
      especially in the context of hardware off-load/acceleration is a challenge and
      requires a number of factors to be taken into consideration: (a) portability,
      (b) performance, and (c) security.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we attack the first two factors and examine the option of
      unikernels and their surrounding ecosystem (application porting frameworks,
      orchestration frameworks, lightweight virtualization backends) in the context
      of hardware acceleration.</p>

      <p>We present our efforts in porting a novel hardware acceleration framework,
      vAccel, to the rumprun unikernel, digging into the internals of semantic
      abstraction for ML inference, as well as its implementation on rumprun and
      QEMU/KVM. We describe the frontend/backend driver port, the runtime needed to
      support the actual execution on the hardware and showcase our results in a

This is an invaluable tools to inspect and to better understand the structure of UNO objects, which is particularly useful for writing macros or extensions.
      The problem is that the existing object inspector tools are not so simple to use, because of their nature as an extension and in addition the user has to search and install it in addition to LibreOffice. For this reasons TDF has offered a tender to implement a build-in tool, that can be more integrated into LibreOffice and is always available to the user.

      <p>Most of the free software projects I know do little to none research with their users. Well: the vast majority do absolutely none, and very few do a teensy little bit, most of the time with the most vocal members of their user base. Why is that? Why is free software afraid of user research?</p>

      <p>This presentation will propose a classification of free software types based on their ideas and attitudes towards user research. The classification is really just a joke, but I hope it will help me debunk some of the misunderstandings and myths that surround user research in free software circles. I will also try to explain what user research is actually about, how it can help your free software project, and give you some advice on how to get started with it.</p>

      <p>We will guide you on how to begin contributing towards Jakarta EE 10. We will cover ways of contributing, what paperwork is needed as well as the likely possibilities for Jakarta EE 10 including high level themes, platform level changes and some detailed features. Some technologies that might change include Jakarta Security, Concurrency, Messaging, Persistence, REST, Batch and Faces. New APIs that could be added include Jakarta NoSQL, MVC and Configuration. We will talk about non-specification projects such as the Tutorial and Samples.</p>

      <p>We will also discuss what might be after Jakarta EE 10. Bring your thinking caps!</p>

      <p>One of the reasons OSS Review Toolkit was started by its creators was a need to go beyond the usual allow/deny license policy in most SCA tools. For instance we wanted to be able to write checks with multiple levels of compliance depending on what was being reviewed or based on package meta data. In this session we will demonstrate how one can write license policy with checks/rules that take into account package metadata date or the code, license and product context.</p>

      <p>Since its inception as SSNES and libsnes, libretro has grown much beyond its humble upbringings. libretro and RetroArch provide a way to connect different applications, emulators and game engines together in a single application.</p>

      <p>libretro has a unique mission design in turning the way applications are built on its head, by enabling the modularization of software. Instead of merely thinking in terms of a standalone application, software is redesigned and re-engineered to become a pluggable module that interfaces through a common API. Standalone applications implement this API to gain access to this module. Our belief is that by following this model, applications can be more easily updated and extended, since there is a clear separation between application and core domain.</p>

      <p>In this session, we will cover:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>What libretro is all about and its software model</li>
      <li>Interesting frontends and hardware you can use</li>

      <p>Many of the challenges developers encounter with CI pipelines stem from the fact that CI is siloed from the rest of the development process:</p>

      <p>• Because development environments are configured separately from CI (and are often pared down and simplified), devs run into hard-to-predict CI errors caused by discrepancies in environments.</p>

      <p>• Integration and end-to-end tests are commonly available only in CI, meaning that troubleshooting these test failures requires long and inefficient feedback loops—every fix requires a developer to push and wait for another CI run.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we will describe and demonstrate how to use the open source project Garden to ensure that environments are consistent and predictable at every step of the pre-production pipeline—from development, to testing, to CI. We’ll also show how to give developers the ability to run integration and end-to-end tests during the development process, making it easier to catch and fix issues when it’s most efficient.</p>

      <p>In 2020, with funding from Mozilla and CZI, the pip packaging team improved pip for all users. These focused on improving the depedenecy resolution for Python packages, and the user experience for all Python users.</p>

      <p>We carried out usability testing, user research and improved error and information messages for pip.</p>

      <p>This talk will be about these improvements - we'll explain how the new dependency resolver works, what it can (and can't do!), how we improved the user experience of pip, the challenges we faced, and why improving user experience is important for open source software.</p>

      <p>This talk with be given by members of the pip team - Pradyun Gedam, Georgia Bullen, Bernard Tyers, and Nicole Harris</p>

      <p>Running old-time OS in a virtual machine often comes with a problem of non-coinciding cursors. A relative positioning device (mouse and trackball) provides the operating system with a vector of the cursor movement instead of its coordinates. As a result, different cursor acceleration formulas are breaking the coincidence of host and guest systems cursor. Fortunately, modern guest operating systems support absolute positioning devices (tablets), which provide real cursor coordinates. Desktop virtualization systems emulate such devices (USB Wacom tablet in case of QEMU), allowing the host cursor to control guest systems in so-called "mouse integration mode".</p>

      <p>Until recent times mouse integration was available only if guest OS either has a driver from the virtual machine vendor or supports USB tablet. In all other situations, desktop virtual machines use "mouse lock mode". The host cursor is hidden, and the user can only interact with the guest system until some dedicated keypress.</p>

      <p>Starting from version 1.9, QEMU had accepted our GSOC-developed patch intended for the osimeline project (HTML-based live demo of historical operating systems) and can emulate the RS-232 Wacom tablet as a "wctablet" character device backend.
      Currently, QEMU is the only virtualization system with such capabilities.</p>

      <p>We've continued working on FreeDOS since then. We released FreeDOS 1.2 in 2016, and are currently working on FreeDOS 1.3. DOS stopped being a moving target in 1995, but FreeDOS re-imagines what a "modern DOS" could look like in 2021. We'll also look at the current state of FreeDOS (FreeDOS 1.3), and what's coming up next (FreeDOS 2.0).</p>

      <p>We've continued working on FreeDOS since then. We released FreeDOS 1.2 in 2016, and are currently working on FreeDOS 1.3. DOS stopped being a moving target in 1995, but FreeDOS re-imagines what a "modern DOS" could look like in 2021. We'll also look at the current state of FreeDOS (FreeDOS 1.3), and what's coming up next (FreeDOS 2.0).</p>

      <p>The talk will be about how I bought a retro keyboard for a VISTA80 from the Canada Science and Technology museum and reversed engineered it to convert it passively to USB. The VISTA80 was a machine built in Canada and was used to "Create pages of text for cable TV systems or to create running lines of text or titles for television displays."¹ The VISTA80 was manufactured around 1995-1997 and was "One of the first character generators to use a computer chip (Intel 8080A) as a controller"¹.</p>

      <p>Spring Framework helped us through dark times and is still a very active and helpful project. But is it the only option for doing any kind of web projects?
      There are many new frameworks around and they have interesting approaches. Especially when we use Kotlin, we might get better Developer Experiences and much better performance results.</p>

      <p>This talk is about showing you some interesting alternatives and hopefully helps you with finding a good fit for your next project</p>

      <p>Commonly used CI systems operate as SAAS solutions, where the user is not
      running the CI stack locally. This lends itself to debugging pitfall as
      developers cannot easily reproduce the problem locally and cannot interactively
      examine it. This talk proposes an inverted design, where self-operated CI tool
      can be used both in the cloud as well as locally, supporting interactive
      debugging sessions.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The recent surge of CI systems has created an interesting new problem, where a
      failure occurs in a specific test environment but does not appear in the
      familiar environment used by the developer.</p>

      <p>This problem is compounded by the batch nature of such systems, where a
      developer can merely push additional patches to some branch to trigger an
      asynchronous execution process.</p>

      <p>During the development of Ubuntu Core operating system, this problem was
      amplified by the fact building and testing a full OS image is a time-consuming
      process, leading to cycles that spanned hours and lead to frustration. Snapd
      developers created the spread program to solve this, among other, problem.</p>

      <p>The SAAS solution became a thin wrapper around spread, which allocates,
      provisions, uses and finally discards the test environment. Crucially, almost
      all errors can be reproduced locally, as spread runs as a standalone tool, using
      QEMU, LXD, Google Compute Engine or Linode as executors.</p>

      <p>This allows anyone to run spread locally, in interactive mode, and explore the
      problem without putting additional load on the centralized CI system, greatly
      improving the debugging process.</p>

      <p>The vision for a new GNU Radio runtime is to have a straightforward implementation of distributed SDR systems that make efficient use of the platform and its accelerators.  Though there have been many projects over the years to address some of these goals, many aspects are challenging to do in the current GNU Radio runtime.</p>

      <p>One year ago, several of us got together at the pre-FOSDEM hackfest and started planning how to "write a GNU Radio runtime that works for humans".  Since that time the project has taken several different directions, all aiming to make the core aspects of GNU Radio modular and easier to use by laying a fresh foundation.  In this talk, we will overview the current state of the "newsched" project, and where we plan to take it.</p>

      <p>In this session, I'll be outlining what I've observed and done as a 'mentor' in the FLOSS design space. What I've tried to do to support designers new to FLOSS in order to 'boost' our numbers actively contributing and keeping our community and OSS healthy. But there's plenty of ground unexplored here, which is why I'd like to spend half of the session actively workshopping via a shared etherpad document how we can mentor designers more sustainably withing FLOS.</p>

      <p>What is needed by those that want mentoring?
      What do FLOSS projects need support with?
      How can mentors share resources and processes?</p>

      <p>and likely, many more questions to collaboratively work on.</p>

      <p>During 2020 we spent the year working with the maintainers of pip, the Python package manager. The project was to implement a new dependency resolver and improve pip's usability. It was a difficult project as personally, I knew very little about software package managers apart from doing "pip install". How do you do UX design with a piece of software used by hundreds of thousands (possibly millions!) of users on a small budget? Where do you find those users? Combined with this the maintainers were under pressure to do a lot of complicated work in a short period of time.</p>

      <p>This session will be a recorded discussion between the UX designers and the pip maintainers. We'll talk about what it was like to spend a year working together, the challenges, and the lessons we can teach others. We'll leave 5 minutes (approx) at the end for Q&amp;A.</p>

      <p>Learn about the missing ingredient from your Docs-as-Code recipe, a headless CMS (Content Management System). Let's understand the problems writers face and how adding a CMS to your Docs toolchain helps solve (some of) them.
      We'll look at a sample docs-as-code repository and then add a CMS to the mix. We'll then go through authoring new topics and editing existing docs with our CMS (Look ma, no Git).</p>
    description: |-
      <p>There's no doubt that the docs-as-code approach for documentation provides a robust workflow, offers immediate product evaluation, and allows you to easily track and revert changes along with many other benefits. However, it also involves other meta tasks such as dealing with Git workflow and managing repositories. There might be times when you need inputs from folks from different departments who don't know Git or don't have access to the platform on which you're hosting your docs repository. For such cases, extending your docs-as-code project by adding a Content Management System (CMS) is surprisingly helpful.</p>

      <p>Having a CMS allows you to create and edit your documentation right from the browser. It's like WordPress for your documentation project. There are many open-source CMS's available, but this talk focuses on a particular CMS that fits best for managing documentation projects. You begin by installing the CMS in your documentation project (or using the pre-baked starter template). Afterward, you configure the CMS and creates forms that map to your content structure. People can then create new content from the browser, which automatically gets converted to a new pull request in your docs repository.</p>

      <p>Learn about the missing ingredient from your Docs-as-Code recipe, a headless CMS (Content Management System). Let's understand the problems writers face and how adding a CMS to your Docs toolchain helps solve (some of) them.
      We'll look at a sample docs-as-code repository and then add a CMS to the mix. We'll then go through authoring new topics and editing existing docs with our CMS (Look ma, no Git).</p>
    raw_description: |-
      <p>There's no doubt that the docs-as-code approach for documentation provides a robust workflow, offers immediate product evaluation, and allows you to easily track and revert changes along with many other benefits. However, it also involves other meta tasks such as dealing with Git workflow and managing repositories. There might be times when you need inputs from folks from different departments who don't know Git or don't have access to the platform on which you're hosting your docs repository. For such cases, extending your docs-as-code project by adding a Content Management System (CMS) is surprisingly helpful.</p>

      <p>Having a CMS allows you to create and edit your documentation right from the browser. It's like WordPress for your documentation project. There are many open-source CMS's available, but this talk focuses on a particular CMS that fits best for managing documentation projects. You begin by installing the CMS in your documentation project (or using the pre-baked starter template). Afterward, you configure the CMS and creates forms that map to your content structure. People can then create new content from the browser, which automatically gets converted to a new pull request in your docs repository.</p>

      <p>Mercurial is a Distributed Version Control System mainly written in Python.
      While it is often the VCS of choice for monorepos for its great scalability,
      certain parts remain slower than they should be.
      Over the past two years, an effort to rewrite parts of the Mercurial core in
      Rust has seen multiple significant wins in performance, even compared to C
      implementations.</p>

      <p>We will go over the different obstacles that Raphaël and his colleagues at
      Octobus faced during the rewrite of the ubiquitous <code>hg status</code>, and the
      solutions they came up with to make this command (and others) a lot faster.
      For example, running <code>hg status</code> in a Mozilla working copy moved from 1.1s to
      0.04s, a ×25 improvement.</p>

      <p>Themes covered include:</p>

      <pre><code>- Rust and Python interoperability
      - Fast (and slow) Rust datastructures
      - Fast directory traversal
      - Version control internals
      - Append-only binary formats
      - Mtime caching
      - Safe mmap usage in a concurrent context
      - Multithreading

      <p>Embedded development is complex enough.
      By automating repetitive parts during development and employing testing, a lot of time can be saved and human errors avoided.
      Additionally, embedded development is usually a team effort: scarce hardware must often be shared between developers and sometimes even with automated testing.
      labgrid is an open source tool for remote control and testing of Embedded Linux Devices in a distributed lab.
      In this talk the presenter takes a look at how labgrid can be used in your Embedded lab
      and what labgrid's developers have learned in over three years of using and developing it.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>At first the presenter takes a closer look at what is actually needed to fully remote-control an Embedded Linux Device:
      What are the typical interfaces that need to be covered? What remote-control hardware is commercially available?</p>

      <p>Next the presenter will focus on the labgrid [0] framework.
      Labgrid is an embedded board control python library, with a focus on testing, development and general automation.
      After a short overview of the key design-concepts the presenter will discuss labgrid's architecture.
      This part finishes with a demo of how interactive development with labgrid looks like and how tests are implemented using pytest.</p>

      <p>The talk will conclude with a lessons-learned with the joy and tears of over three years of active labgrid development and use.</p>

      <p>Fluence is an open application platform where apps can build on each other, share data and users. Fluence not only allows hosting services inside p2p network but also provides JS SDK for building web applications, which communicate with the services.
      After the introductory talk, we will dive right into something very practical. We will demonstrate the process of making a web application with Fluence JS SDK. We will start with an empty create-react-app project and work our way towards the fully functional solution.
      By the end of this talk, we will develop a text editor, which synchronizes it’s state and the user online status with collaborators over Fluence p2p network. The application will be interacting with two minimalistic services pre-deployed to Fluence: user-list and history, but all of the features will be implemented on client-side without any need to modify existing software.

      <p>Much of the Secure and Trusted Boot ecosystem is built around UEFI. However, not all platforms implement UEFI, including IBM's Power machines.</p>

      <p>In this talk, I will talk about my team's ongoing work on secure boot of virtual machines on Power. This is an important use case, as many Power machines ship with a firmware hypervisor, and all user workloads run as virtual machines or "Logical Partitions" (LPARs).</p>

      <p>Linux Virtual Machines on Power boot via an OpenFirmware (IEEE1275) implementation which is loaded by the hypervisor. The OpenFirmware implementation then loads grub from disk, and grub then loads Linux. To secure this, we propose to:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>Teach grub how to verify Linux-module-style "appended signatures". Distro kernels for Power are already signed with these signatures for use with the OpenPower 'host' secure boot scheme.</p></li>
      <li><p>Sign grub itself with an appended signature, allowing firmware to verify grub.</p></li>

      <p>Containerizing Java applications is not a trivial task and also there is a learning curve involved as you have to get yourself familiar with tool-specific commands etc.</p>

      <p>I can say from personal experience that not all Java developers are container experts.</p>

      <p>For example, first, you should have docker installed and then you have to maintain a Dockerfile. Then over a period of time, the image size grows and you start trying things like multi-stage builds to reduce your image size and have only required dependency for your application.</p>

      <p>A developer ideally should not be worrying about these things. With Jib, you don't deal with such complexities and you just have to add a plugin to your build tool Maven or Gradle and you are good to go. It takes care of your image building and pushing to the container registry.</p>

      <p>With the growing popularity of Go many people are asking how to build a solid GUI. The language design to target concurrency and portability makes it a great match for cross-platform development.
      This talk shows how the Fyne toolkit is designed to help make beautiful and idiomatic native apps with Go.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>This talk explores the Fyne toolkit and what is new with the recently released version 2.0.
      We will explore the main features including canvas, widgets, data binding, test support and app store packaging.</p>

      <p>We will step through how to build an application using standard widgets, data binding and storage, and then see how it can be distributed for practically all graphical operating systems and app stores.</p>

      <p>Developing for multi-platform is picking up speed as the Kotlin Multi-Platform gets better with every release. That mostly means that shared logic is being written in Kotlin which can then be targeted to many target platforms. Up until recently it wasn't easy to develop UI for multiple platforms on the Desktop side. That is changing with the introduction of Compose for Desktop, which will allow building application UI for Linux, macOS and Windows.</p>

      <p>In this session you will get to understand what is Compose for Desktop, how does it work and how can you jump right into building for multiple platforms opening up the vast domains other than the mobile.</p>

      <p>Dependency management in the Kotlin and in the JVM ecosystems is great, especially for Gradle users, but there's room for improvement.</p>

      <p>Some tasks, like upgrading dependencies to the right versions, are still tedious and time consuming. There's also compatibility gotchas because of the lack of metadata.</p>

      <p>This talk will start with a mention of the different problems that come with dependency management in real-world projects.
      Then it'll show how the developer tool <a href="https://github.com/jmfayard/refreshVersions">refreshVersions</a> (MIT licensed) tackles some of these issues in Gradle projects, saving a lot of time when upgrading dependencies.</p>

      <p>Finally, I'll talk about what the future can be for dependency management, be it from new features in future Gradle versions, or tools or conventions that the community can create to improve the status quo.</p>

      <p>Unlike GPU cards, quantum acceleration is unlikely to be available as a personal computer in the near future. Right now all the known quantum computers are owned by major players.

      <p>The first part of the session introduces an open-source co-processor model where classical computers can offload specialized tasks that are better suited to quantum computers thus lowering the onramp to incorporating quantum computing into applications today.</p>

      <p>The next part of the sessions demonstrate how to build a co-processor model on the cloud using two community operators that provide quantum acceleration by leveraging Qiskit, an open-source SDK for developing quantum circuits, classical components powered by Red Hat OpenShift and IBM Quantum Experience as the quantum backend</p>

      <p>Most SCA vendors target large organizations, are expensive, and generally not economically viable for smaller companies who might be a critical part of larger software distribution chains. Smaller companies for these reasons can’t get access to proper SCA tooling, and large organizations will have to carry the expense of auditing their suppliers.</p>

      <p>Leading to a higher cost of OSS governance, no ability to compare results, exclusion of the OSS community behind a license-fee and a reliance on external auditing. With this proposal we aim to contribute a free, standardized and 100% open alternative.</p>

      <p>Most SCA vendors target large organizations, are expensive, and generally not economically viable for smaller companies who might be a critical part of larger software distribution chains. Smaller companies for these reasons can’t get access to proper SCA tooling, and large organizations will have to carry the expense of auditing their suppliers.</p>

      <p>Leading to a higher cost of OSS governance, no ability to compare results, exclusion of the OSS community behind a license-fee and a reliance on external auditing. With this proposal we aim to contribute a free, standardized and 100% open alternative.</p>

      <p>SDKMAN is the Software Development Kit Manager. It is fast becoming the defacto standard for installing JDKs and other JVM related SDKs on the CLI. It's a Free and Open Source tool with the primary purpose to making developers' lives less painful!</p>

      <p>This talk will begin with a demo of how SDKMAN can be used in your daily workflow. We will show you how to install multiple Candidate Versions side by side and how to switch between them. We will also look at some of the other functionalities that it offers. We will then take a peek under the hood and see how SDKMAN works both in the CLI as well as the serverside backend.</p>

      <p>Finally, we will take a look at other aspects of what SDKMAN brings, including Vendoring, Community Contribution and Future plans.</p>

      <p>If you really don't know what SDKMAN is, or if you would like to have a peek under the hood at what it does or how it does it, this talk is a must for you!</p>

      <p>With the release of JDK 16, we will have had eight (yes eight!) versions of Java in less than four years.</p>

      <p>We still hear claims that Java is the new COBOL, and its popularity is in decline.  The reality, however, is that Java developers are now being provided with new features at a faster pace than at any time in its 25-year history.</p>

      <p>Many of these new features provide exciting new language level changes, as well as useful new APIs.</p>

      <p>In this session, we’ll explore in detail what these changes are and how best to use them (as well as advice on when not to use them).  We’ll also explain the significance of preview features and incubator modules.</p>

      <p>We’ll cover the following new language features:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Local variable type inference (JDK 10)</li>
      <li>Switch expressions (JDK 12)</li>
      <li>Text blocks (JDK 13)</li>
      <li>Records (JDK 14)</li>
      <li>Pattern matching for instanceof (JDK 14)</li>
      <li>Sealed classes and changes to Records (JDK 15)</li>
      </ul>


      <p>For each of these JDKs, we’ll also highlight the most useful additions to the core class libraries and changes in the HotSpot JVM.</p>

      <p>In 2020, the GNU Radio organization went through some major changes. In the past, the leadership of GNU Radio followed a "benevolent dictator" model. This is an efficient leadership structure, but it assumes dictators' benevolence, and is not a scalable model.
      Starting 2020, we have a new leader ship team (the General Assembly), and a new Board. With the exception of the initial General Assembly, all members are elected, and there's an official process in place to keep the organization going.</p>

      <p>On top of that, we merged with The SETI Project. We are hopeful that this collaboration is a great win for both parties, and we'll talk about why.</p>

      <p>In late 2020 the GitOps Working Group was formed under the App Delivery SIG of the CNCF. The goal for the WG is to “provide companies and individuals with the skills, knowledge and competency to implement GitOps tooling and methodologies which simplify the operation and management of infrastructure and cloud native applications.” Within days of the announcement more than 60 individuals from more the 30 companies expressed an interest in participating and the working group was launched. The group is meeting these goals through content creation and evangelism – white papers, blog posts, sample applications, demonstrations and more.</p>

      <p>In this session we will present work done to date with a primary focus on the foundational principles of GitOps and the benefits that practitioners are already realizing. The aim of the session is both to help the interested understand the fundamentals of GitOps and know where to go to engage.</p>

      <p>The push for paperless bureaucracy has been going on for quite some time, but the circumstances of the past year made the issue even more pressing than it already was.</p>

      <p>PDF has played---and continues to play---an important role in this digitalisation process. This is in large part due to the format's reputation for robust, platform-independent rendering, but its easy-to-use, natively supported security features are another key selling point.
      PDF documents can be encrypted using AES or public-key encryption to keep their contents away from prying eyes, and the PDF specification also includes native support for redacting documents before public release.
      Last but not least, electronic PDF signatures as a replacement for old-school "wet ink" signatures have been a major factor in moving towards paperless workflows for companies and governments alike.</p>

      <p>Document security is a complicated and broad subject, with many different facets that often conflict with one another.
      In particular, developers of workflows handling sensitive documents regularly face tough judgment calls weighing security requirements against ease of use.
      The security features in the PDF specification provide a standard framework to respond to these needs.
      In this talk, we'll discuss how you can leverage PDF to build secure, yet user-friendly document workflows.
      In the context of digital signing, we'll go over what it means to "trust" a digital signature, and how that trust is validated in practice.
      In addition, the talk wil touch upon some of the common pitfalls in PDF security that you should be aware of to prevent your documents from being exploited.</p>

      <p>RISC-V is a relatively new ISA and platform, which has been evolving rapidly. A few Linux distributions already have good support and have compiled most of their packages for it. The boot process has been neglected and only recently did everyone start using the widely used embedded bootloader U-Boot instead of a custom research bootloader. We have ported the EDK2 reference implementation of UEFI to make the boot process more like current desktops and servers. This talk explains how we did that, how it works and how we got Linux to boot.
      We also want to explain what's left to do and how we can move in the direction of a RISC-V server platform.</p>

    abstract: "<p>Learn how to provide enhanced media capabilities (such as music
      on hold playbacks, PIN prompts, barge-in services, etc) to calls that are passing
      through OpenSIPS SIP Proxy.</p>"
    description: |-
      <p>SIP proxies, by definition, lack the ability to do any media handling, due to the fact that they only stand in the path of call signalling, but not call media (as opposed to a B2B media server, which behaves as an endpoint for both media and signalling). So, how do you keep your OpenSPIS as a performant SIP proxy, but also enhance your SIP service with extra media capabilities? Starting version 3.1, OpenSIPS provides the means of controlling and changing the RTP streams of the ongoing calls  without altering the signalling path of the call (i.e. without transferring the call to a B2B media server), as the calls should be easily resumed to its initial state.</p>

      <p>A set of examples where manipulating media in an ongoing call can be useful, while preserving its signalling path, are:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>inject an audio/video announcement</p></li>
      <li><p>playback music on hold files</p></li>
      <li><p>fork media for call recording, or for call listening</p></li>
      <li><p>inject media for call whispering</p></li>
      <li><p>temporary barge in an ongoing call</p></li>
      </ul>


      <p>All these features, and many others can be implemented by simply mixing the participants of multiple calls.
      This presentation describes how all these features can be implemented in OpenSIPS 3.1 using the new Media Exchange module, without changing the SIP signalling path, but only by exchanging SDP bodies between different SIP sessions.</p>

After the recently introduced opensips-cli console environment, aimed at improving the interaction with an OpenSIPS 3.0+ server, we are proud to introduce the Call API -- a responsive, fully asynchronous, high-throughput API, built to abstract all the complexity behind the more arcane SIP calling scenarios (think click-to-dial scenarios, blind transfers, attended transfers, etc.) into intuitive, easy-to-invoke JSON-RPC commands.</p>

      <p>The first half of the presentation will include an architectural overview of the API.  You will learn how to interact with it, how the API further interacts with the OpenSIPS backend, as well as some best practices on writing API clients in your favourite programming language.</p>

      <p>In the second half, you will learn about the specific SIP scenarios exposed by the API, how they work behind the curtains and what kind of services you can build on top of them.</p>

      <p>Today computer systems are often built with an implicit hierarchy. It can be seen as a way to enforce existing power structures. The very act of making software entails describing exactly how the system can be used and for what. Furthermore, ever more data about the usage of systems is gathered. This combined with machine learning has given rise to a whole new class of systems that can be very hard to reason about. Especially given that the data or the algorithms can be controlled or bought by external parties.</p>

      <p>What if that doesn't need to be the case, what if we could make software that is both subjective and in control of the user. I will be presenting one such system - Scuttlebutt, detail how it is different from the systems described above, and also different from federated systems.</p>

      <p>In this particular talk, we delve into how Scuttlebutt apps can be built straight in the browser, no additional application needed. With the expert at hand there will be plenty of time to dive in and explore your own ideas once learning how to build your own SSB apps in the browser.</p>

This combined with machine learning has given rise to a whole new class of systems that can be very hard to reason about. Especially given that the data or the algorithms can be controlled or bought by external parties.</p>

      <p>What if that doesn't need to be the case, what if we could make software that is both subjective and in control of the user. I will be presenting one such system - Scuttlebutt, detail how it is different from the systems described above, and also different from federated systems.</p>

      <p>In this particular talk, we delve into how Scuttlebutt apps can be built straight in the browser, no additional application needed. With the expert at hand there will be plenty of time to dive in and explore your own ideas once learning how to build your own SSB apps in the browser.</p>

      <p>Welcome to Scuttlebutt!</p>

      <p>A walkthrough and introduction to the Scuttleverse. Here we explore real life projects and guide you in connecting with the main network.
      A hands on workshop for those looking to try out Scuttlebutt.</p>

      <p>Like other social platforms, you can send messages to your friends and share posts onto a feed. The cool thing is that the underlying technology here means that messages are passed directly between friends via a peer-to-peer (p2p) gossip protocol.</p>

      <p>As a decentralized social network, Scuttlebutt passes the data from friend to friend, without any central server. The data is localised and distributed so it also happens to work offline!</p>

      <p>In a few weeks we are launching COMPOST, a magazine about the digital commons. Each issue serves as a collective lab, where we test and validate novel approaches to content production, distribution, and monetization, with a unique cohort of contributors every quarter. Through subsequent issues of COMPOST, our learnings and code will be published to the commons as Distributed Press. Along with inspiring creators and readers with our magazine, our objective is to develop better open-source tools for decentralized publishing to catalyze an interdependent ecology of publishing projects.</p>

      <p>In our talk, we will present the organizational and technical scaffolding of COMPOST and Distributed Press. We will share our learnings from the first issue working directly with writers and artists to inform features and user experience of our tool. We will present how Distributed Press will help publish works to the DWeb (IPFS, Hypercore, Scuttlebutt), enable monetization, add a disintermediated social layer to publishing, and verify content, in a manner aligned with our values. Finally, we will talk about radical practices that ensure decentralization extends into governance, decision making, and community building.</p>

Running yarn start gives you, the developer, a Holochain Conductor admin app for managing Demo Agents, installing your new app and launching your app with the crypto keys for each Demo Agent. There are four web apps launched making it super easy to see how your app really works for each Agent.
      That's not all, using the same technique you can add "modules" of functionality to your app plus you can add new layouts, views and entry types.
      Come and see how easy it is to build a fully distributed, p2p, secure, fast, reliable and great looking app for the new world!</p>

      <p>The new QUIC and HTTP/3 protocols are finally here! With their standardization at the IETF almost complete and several mature implementations being deployed, we can start looking into which performance improvements they bring in practice. There's just one problem though: they're quite complex and difficult to test. Using high level tooling like lighthouse might show that they're faster or slower, but rarely why.</p>

      <p>But problems are there to be solved, and that's what I've been doing for the past 2 years with the qlog and qvis projects. The qlog structured endpoint logging format (https://github.com/quiclog/internet-drafts) is supported by over 70% of all QUIC implementations and allows you to extract low-level protocol information in JSON directly from the client and server. These traces can then be loaded for analysis in different interactive visualizations in our open-source qvis toolsuite (https://qvis.edm.uhasselt.be). This brings an unparalleled opportunity to analyze performance problems and opportunities to the new protocols, as these tools start where the browser devtools end.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we will explore QUIC and HTTP/3's main performance oriented features, such as 0-RTT connection establishment, advanced congestion and flow control, stream multiplexing and prioritization, and Head-of-Line blocking removal in-depth. We discuss how they are supposed to work, why it's not always that easy in practice, and of course: how to diagnose issues with these features using qlog and qvis. We will use concrete examples of bugs found in major implementations to teach how to interpret the behavior of these new protocols, based on some of our research (https://qlog.edm.uhasselt.be/epiq).</p>

      <p>We explain how to properly approach testing the new protocols in the future, as great care should be taken in interpreting any results and their root causes. Along the way we debunk some common misconceptions on the protocols and their potential improvements (no, the fact that QUIC runs on top of UDP does not mean it no longer needs congestion control or magically becomes faster, no matter what that Hackernews commenter claims).</p>

      <p>It's 2021, and we are in a climate emergency.</p>

      <p>If you're a web professional, you've probably figured out that if the internet runs on electricity, and a lot of electricity comes from burning fossil fuels, there are steps we can take as technologists to make our use of the internet measurably more sustainable, by changing how we use digital infrastructure.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we'll cover some of the levers available to you as a maker of digital services, and how we can extend open source tools to help design greener, more accessible, more performant websites.</p>

      <p>We'll show examples from companies you've heard of doing this in production right now, and give clear next steps for those beginning their climate journey.</p>

    abstract: |-
      <p>For the past few decades, radio astronomy has been a rapidly developing area of observational astronomy. This is due to the fact that a variety of celestial objects emit electromagnetic radiation at radio wavelengths, which has led to the development of radio telescopes capable of revealing the otherwise-hidden astrophysical properties of the universe. An important requirement that makes radio astronomy observations and analysis possible is an appropriate software pipeline compatible with the spectrometers with which radio observatories are equipped. In this work, we present Virgo: a versatile software solution for radio telescopes.</p>

      <p>Virgo is an easy-to-use open-source spectrometer and radiometer based on Python and GNU Radio (GR) that is conveniently applicable to any radio telescope working with a GR-supported software-defined radio (SDR).

    raw_abstract: |-
      <p>For the past few decades, radio astronomy has been a rapidly developing area of observational astronomy. This is due to the fact that a variety of celestial objects emit electromagnetic radiation at radio wavelengths, which has led to the development of radio telescopes capable of revealing the otherwise-hidden astrophysical properties of the universe. An important requirement that makes radio astronomy observations and analysis possible is an appropriate software pipeline compatible with the spectrometers with which radio observatories are equipped. In this work, we present Virgo: a versatile software solution for radio telescopes.</p>

      <p>Virgo is an easy-to-use open-source spectrometer and radiometer based on Python and GNU Radio (GR) that is conveniently applicable to any radio telescope working with a GR-supported software-defined radio (SDR). In addition to data acquisition, Virgo also carries out automated analysis of the recorded samples, producing an averaged spectrum, a calibrated spectrum, a dynamic spectrum (waterfall), a time series (power vs time) and a total power distribution plot.</p>

      <p>By additionally providing the observer with an important set of utilities, Virgo also makes for a great tool for planning (radio) observations. This includes the ability to compute the position of astronomical sources in the sky for a given date, estimate the right ascension and declination given the observer's coordinates along with the altitude and azimuth the telescope is pointing to and convert equatorial to galactic coordinates with the help of the open-source Astropy package.</p>

    abstract: <p>We sometimes hear statements like "Mozilla is one of the oldest Free
      &amp; Open Source projects in existence today, with more than 20 years of history
      - and still going strong". But where exactly did this project come from? What
      happened early in its history? What did the project go through to come to where
      it is today? This talk will try to answer those questions and compress multiple
      decades into less than an hour - or at least give an overview of the big-picture
      events this project lived through. As the audience may be more familiar with
      recent than earlier years, more emphasis will be put on times when the project
      was still young - for some things even reaching back to times before the speaker
      joined the community in 1999. After attending this talk, you will hopefully
      have a better understanding of the background of the Mozilla project and how
      it has helped shaping the web for the better, something that will hopefully
      continue into the future.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The roots of Mozilla go back almost to the beginning of the web itself. The first broadly used web browser in university circles was NCSA Mosaic - the co-writer of that piece of software created a commercial variant back in 1993, going under the commercial name of "Netscape" when it was released and became the first major web browser in Internet history. But its code name, right from the start, was "Mozilla".
      When Netscape open-sourced its code in March of 1998, that code name became the public name of the open source project, and over the years, Mozilla attracted a large community of developers, localizers, and more. A non-profit Mozilla Foundation was created, with a "corporation" subsidiary for tax reasons, and a huge list of projects and products have been associated with Mozilla over its more than 20 years of history. The most well-known is of course the Firefox web browser, which has been one of the most-used open-source products for many years - hundreds of thousands of people browse the web with Mozilla Firefox even nowadays.
      After decades, this project and community is still going strong - hopefully continuing to do so in the future.</p>

      <p>The speaker has been with this community for over 20 years himself and the talk will give you and overview of the origin, past, and present of this interesting project.</p>

    raw_abstract: <p>We sometimes hear statements like "Mozilla is one of the oldest
      Free &amp; Open Source projects in existence today, with more than 20 years
      of history - and still going strong". But where exactly did this project come
      from? What happened early in its history? What did the project go through to
      come to where it is today? This talk will try to answer those questions and
      compress multiple decades into less than an hour - or at least give an overview
      of the big-picture events this project lived through. As the audience may be
      more familiar with recent than earlier years, more emphasis will be put on times
      when the project was still young - for some things even reaching back to times
      before the speaker joined the community in 1999. After attending this talk,
      you will hopefully have a better understanding of the background of the Mozilla
      project and how it has helped shaping the web for the better, something that
      will hopefully continue into the future.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we’ll discuss what the Kotlin team is working on, the priorities we have, and the additions you can expect in the language.</p>

      <p>The JVM platform is evolving, and Kotlin is keeping up with the new features as they become available. This includes the features introduced by the upcoming Project Valhalla and JVM support for sealed classes and records. In this talk, we’ll discuss how these changes affect Kotlin as a language, and how the Kotlin team finds a balance between drawing on the power of the new JVM versions, supporting the same functionality in older versions, and providing a smooth transition. We'll also talk about how you, the community, can influence the design and evolution of the language!</p>

      <li>Pros and cons of using Open Source software in safety</li>
      <li>Examples of Open Source Software being used in safety applications today</li>

      <li>Requirements analysis, and verification and validation techniques (including creating argumentation to prove that software is safe enough to use)</li>
      <li>What we need to do as FOSS creators to shift the industry mentality around the use of FOSS vs. current safety standards</li>
      <li>Open Source Development practices and how we can map these to practices such as the V-model which are needed for current industry safety standards (e.g. IEC 61508, ISO 26262 ect.)</li>

      <p>There are a lot of juicy stories from the trenches to be told on infrastructure drift.</p>

      <p>Sure enough, we all do GitOps by the book! Or we all have the right processes in place. But we also have to interact with other teams. We also have to grant some level of access to our infrastructures to some services or tools that may eventually generate uncontrolled changes. What if we couldn't catch them all? What if all drift reporting so far was faulty?</p>

      <p>You can't efficiently improve what you don't track. We track coverage for unit tests, why not infrastructure as code coverage? How can we make sure our infrastructure code matches our actual infrastructure state? In this talk, using Terraform with AWS resources, I will show how infrastructure drift can go undetected despite our best efforts or tooling and cause issues and end the talk by showing our own tool driftctl, (just released under Apache-2.0 licence) that tracks IaC coverage and warns of infrastructure drift.</p>

      <p>“We are all YAML engineers now” as Bob Walker said in 2018 in Ghent. So we now need something to manage these millions of lines of YAML.
      There’s the “Kubernetes application management tools” list by Bryan Grant with over 120 tool aiming at config management for Kubernetes. This area is evolving fast, and as k8s users we need some guidance to make informed decisions on what to use.
      In this talk I’ll describe the problem I need to solve and take a look into what we can learn from the previous generation of cfg mgmt tools. Then, will show some of the new tools and methods.

      <p>“We are all YAML engineers now” as Bob Walker said in 2018 in Ghent. So we now need something to manage these millions of lines of YAML.
      There’s the “Kubernetes application management tools” list by Bryan Grant with over 120 tool aiming at config management for Kubernetes. This area is evolving fast, and as k8s users we need some guidance to make informed decisions on what to use.
      In this talk I’ll describe the problem I need to solve and take a look into what we can learn from the previous generation of cfg mgmt tools. Then, will show some of the new tools and methods. Will not go into details of each solution, but rather compare different approaches and discuss which is good for specific needs.</p>

      <p>How we manage Facebook's desktop Linux fleet, and how it is positioned as a way to drive features into our server fleet.
      Facebook runs CentOS on its server fleet, and offers Fedora (and soon, CentOS) as supported Linux distributions on laptops and desktops. This is a recent development - we previously recommended Ubuntu LTS as a self-supported option, but found that switching to Fedora (and officially supporting it) allows for not only reusing the infrastructure already used in the server fleet (e.g. the pipeline for creating packages) but also to serve as an integration point for driving features into CentOS.
      I'll also discuss how we manage the desktop fleet, and contrast it with how servers are managed.</p>

      Shipping operational knowledge into a software is a big milestone towards better configuration management.
      In this talk, I will explain how we introduced configuration management practices into release management team while leveraging the software engineering principles during this journey.
      I will start by clarifying what problem(s) were we trying to solve, namely: Lack of system Reliability, huge dependencies among silos, Rework between Dev, QA and release teams.
      Then, I will explain the solution that I proposed to solve these problems, namely: Service Offering Model, Killing environments gap and treating everything as CI (Configuration item).
      After that , I will move forward on challenges that I faced while trying to solve the issue: migration from Legacy system, security compliance &amp; disconnected environment, .. and others.
      Finally, I will give overview about the solution implementation.</p>

    description: |-
      <p>In a micro service based architecture it's common to have to manage configurations and secrets based on different variables, such as the microservice, flavors of the microservice, the execution environment and data center, etc. Since it is an arduous task both in the time needed to add a new variable and to refactor existing ones I have created MHConfig.</p>

      <p>MHConfig is a microservice in charge of composing configurations and secrets according to different labels and notifying the clients who use it when a change has occurred, providing various features to facilitate this work as references to recurrent or global values, traceability of the clients using a configuration, access control lists to prevent obtain to other microservice configurations/secrets, etc.</p>

    raw_abstract: "<p>How to compose the configuration and secrets of microservices
      taking into account various variables without dying in the attempt.</p>"
    raw_description: |-
      <p>In a micro service based architecture it's common to have to manage configurations and secrets based on different variables, such as the microservice, flavors of the microservice, the execution environment and data center, etc. Since it is an arduous task both in the time needed to add a new variable and to refactor existing ones I have created MHConfig.</p>

      <p>MHConfig is a microservice in charge of composing configurations and secrets according to different labels and notifying the clients who use it when a change has occurred, providing various features to facilitate this work as references to recurrent or global values, traceability of the clients using a configuration, access control lists to prevent obtain to other microservice configurations/secrets, etc.</p>

      <p>In this session I'm going to talk about how the tool works and how it can help solve common problems when managing configurations and secrets in a complex environment.</p>

      <p>The "pet vs cattle" thing is getting pretty long in the tooth, but the one thing one keeps hearing is that the management layer somehow always remains a pet.
      While there is certainly <em>some</em> truth to that - you don't want to rebuild your management plane every day - wouldn't it be cool if you could?
      In this talk we will show how to fully automate the deployment and configuration of <a href="https://theforeman.org">Foreman</a> using <a href="https://ansible.com">Ansible</a>, which allows for reproducible setups, redeployments and testing environments that actually match production.
      The presented solution should not (and can not) replace working backups, but it might still save you when the restore isn't going as expected or someone asks to start "fresh" while keeping all the important details the same as before.
      We will show how to deploy Foreman from scratch in an reproducible way, reusing the same bits the project uses itself. This will also include plugins like <a href="https://theforeman.org/plugins/katello/">Katello</a> and <a href="https://theforeman.org/plugins/foreman_ansible/">Ansible</a> for best possible client management later.
      We'll continue with integrating Foreman with compute resources and managing content in Katello, which will result in trivial deployments of further cattle systems from Foreman, which then can be managed via Ansible.
      The result is a set of playbooks that can be stored in a git repository and deployed at will.</p>

      <p>Bitswap is a Block Exchange protocol designed for P2P Content Addressable Networks. It leverages merkle-linked graphs in order to parallelize retrieval and verify content integrity. Bitswap is being used in the InterPlanetary File System architecture as the main content exchange protocol, as well as in the Filecoin network as part of the block synchronisation protocol. In this work, we present Bitswap’s baseline design and then apply several new extensions with the goal of improving Bitswap’s efficiency and efficacy and minimizing its bandwidth fingerprint. Most importantly, our extensions result in a substantial increase to the protocol’s content discovery rate. This is achieved by using the wealth of information that the protocol acquires from the content routing subsystem to make smarter decisions on where to fetch the content from.</p>

      <p>This talk is focused on sharing the operation of Bitswap, the testbed we build to test improvements of Bitswap, and the ways in which we improved Bitswap building the foundation for research lines on file-sharing in P2P networks.</p>

    raw_abstract: "<p>Microwatt is an open-source POWER CPU implementation which can
      run on cheap FPGAs, bringing new level of accessibility to POWER. In the last
      year, we have added to Microwatt features such as a memory management unit,
      privilege modes, interrupts, a floating-point unit, an interrupt controller
      and a level-2 cache, so that now it can boot Linux. This presentation will outline
      these new additions to Microwatt and talk about some interesting applications
      for Microwatt.</p>"

    abstract: <p>JavaScript runs everywhere. Or so it should! In this 30min talk we're
      going to skim over 10 small proof of concepts that relied on JavaScript to do
      something new. We'll conclude with an overview of useful technical and social
      patterns helpful to run "nearly" JS nearly everywhere.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>A computer is an amazing piece of technology because it is generic. It is a general purpose device par excellence. Without going as abstract as Turing machines we wish we could run any code everywhere. Several things get in the way though : performances, design choices, business strategy, available implementation, etc. Yet, when you consider buying a new device or repurposing an old one patterns seem to be coming back over and over again, namely : is a browser present? Can I run a web server on it? Which protocols are available? Is there any usable file format to send or receive data? By efficiently identifying those new opportunities emerge. One can then connect one device to another even if they are not your usual computer. This talk is going to explore such patterns through 10 small examples built over last year. From a vibrating sex toy available on a social VR platform to a Linux phone controlling a TV like a remote or a virtual light bulb controlled by strangers and matching its physical equivalent, exotic hardware is going to leverage JavaScript, one way or another.</p>

      <p>This presentation targets a curious audience. Basic knowledge of JavaScript, Internet of Things, virtual reality, augmented reality, embedded devices are welcomed but not necessary. The slides provide links to code snippets and all used libraries.</p>

      <p>Assessing whether a system is safe, requires understanding the system sufficiently. If the system depends on Linux, it is important to understand Linux within that system context and how Linux is used in that system. The challenge is selecting Linux components and features that can be evaluated for safety and identifying gaps that exist where more work is needed to evaluate safety sufficiently.</p>

      <p>The ELISA project has taken on the challenge to make it easier for companies to build and certify Linux-based safety-critical applications. This talk will be given by Shuah Khan from the Linux Foundation to give an overview of the ELISA project and its technical strategy.</p>

      <p>The advantages of Free and Open Source Software are numerous, benefiting industry partners, individual contributors and the wider community who collaborate to advance state of the art. More than ever companies choose FOSS, however the world of safety is behind the curve. Software developed for safety applications often use old development practices and are closed source. Too commonly this code is seen as a competitive advantage, and having spent vast sums developing and analysing for safety, companies are reluctant to share their code. Ultimately this is to the detriment of everyone, and leaves us all vulnerable to unsafe software.</p>

      <p>This talk will outline the problems with software in safety currently, detail how using FOSS practices could benefit not just the wider community but the leading industry suppliers, and talk about what we need to do as FOSS creators to convince industry that this is the way forward and make the software we use safer for all.</p>

      PGDG.  Together with his colleague Teodor Sigaev he developed infrastructure
      for implementing user-define index access methods GiST, GIN and SP-GiST,
      built-in full-text search facilities in PostgreSQL (formerly known as
      tsearch2) and a number of popular extensions like intarray, ltree, hstore,
      pg_trgm, jsquery and rum access method.  His latest contributions are jsonb
      and implementation of SQL/JSON.</p>

      <p>Oleg graduated from the Astronomy department of the Physics department at
      Lomonosov's Moscow State University.  During his professional work at
      Sternberg Astronomical Institute (SAI MSU) he realized he needed a free and
      powerful open-source database like PostgreSQL (Postgres95 that time).  Since
      then he extensively used PostgreSQL in his scientific work and many other
      projects.  Oleg is an active member of Russian PostgreSQL community,
      he advocated the adoption of PostgreSQL by astronomical community.</p>

      <p>Marcus' history began when one of his ancestors decided to leave the safety of an equatorial tree; over generations, his ancestors began wondering more and more about what the optimum Software Defined Radio framework would be, but it would be no earlier than with the feasibility of SDR on general purpose computers that a member of this long line of experts realized this affinity.</p>

      <p>Being raised in a very SDR-affine lab, it only took a few scientific experiments until Marcus became the architect of GNU Radio, when he's not working at CEL on his PhD. He likes long walks, good conversation and has developed a high level of nerdiness, which allows him to communicate with all sorts of people. He can often be found in the hedges of Southern Germany picking fruit and stuffing it into his face plumage. He is not a playable character.</p>

      Through his startup Open Kernel Labs his L4-embedded/OKL4 microkernel has been

      of all recent iOS devices. He led the Trustworthy Systems team at NICTA in Sydney

      a machine-checked correctness proof of its implementation, which triggered massive
      interest in formal verification of OS code, and led to the SIGOPS Hall of Fame
      Award in 2019. As part of the DARPA HACMS Program, his team demonstrated the
      incremental cyber retrofit of legacy military systems, using seL4 to protect
      vulnerable autonomous systems from cyber attacks. His current focus is on extending
      security and safety guarantees from the microkernel to complete systems, principled

    description: |-
      <p>I love crafting great, accessible and user-centric experiences. I have been working in the web industry for over a decade now. I already worked as an Interaction, UI and UX Designer for eight years. In addition, I have more than twelve years of experience as a visual frontend developer with a focus on UI &amp; Animation. I also bring in experience with leading a mixed team of Designers and Frontend Developers.</p>

      <p>My T-shaped profile helps me creating great user experiences from simple prototypes to shippable products. This also enables me to take a lot of technical aspects into account already in the conception phase of a feature. I love to break new grounds and to come up with innovative solutions.</p>

      <p>While working for the well-known Swiss agencies Unic and Amazee Labs, I was able to work for national and international brands like SBB, SRF, Audi, Nobel Biocare, Zurich Tourism, Drupal, Aduno Group and many more. I was also honored with several awards for my work.</p>

      <p>I am also engaged in a series of different community activities. I volunteer co-organising Front Conference Zurich, a Zurich based conference where we have talks about Design, Frontend and everything in between. I am a longstanding Member of the Board and responsible for the speaker selection.</p>

      <p>Open Source projects are something I do value and support. That’s why I’m deeply involved in the Drupal Open Source Project as a Lead Designer where I work on the Drupal Design System and the core admin theme Claro. I'm also the creator of the Gin Admin theme which started as a playground to envision how the Drupal admin UI potentially could look like in the future but then eventually there was a lot of buzz about this that I started it as a contrib theme you can already use right now.</p>

      <p>I also do like to speak publicly about all things Design and/or Drupal. This currently includes the Drupal Design System, the all-new Admin UI, the Future of the Admin UI and how we can improve the Content Editor Experience for customers.</p>

    description: |-
      <p>Being interested in fields like programming, electronics, science, physics, and space, Gonzalo J. Carracedo studied computer engineering at Universidade da Coruña (Spain) in 2007-2011, got a master's degree in mathematical engineering from Universidade de Santiago de Compostela (Spain) and Modelization and Simulation from École Centrale Paris (France). Former CTF player in the spanish team Painsec, he has been working as a software engineer and white-hat hacker in different companies since 2013, performing tasks like reverse engineering pirated FTA Satellite TV receivers and analyzing the vulnerabilities of PLC-based smart electricity meter networks in Spain.</p>

      <p>He is also a ham radio operator (callsign EA1IYR) and spends his spare time researching radio propagation, signal processing, and blind demodulation of unknown signals. He's well known for his space-consuming experiments like a homemade primary-focus 3-m HI radiotelescope and a smaller 1.2-m C-Band radiotelescope, and CPU-consuming open source projects like SigDigger. Fortunately, not everything in his life is devoted to technical stuff, and gets some good old mind detox taking theatre classes.</p>

      <p>If you run into him and starts talking to you about something overly niche about how CO molecules emit radio photons because of their rotational modes, it is totally okay to ask him to stop, he has a hard time telling when he's being too passionate about something around others. In fact, he's probably going to thank you for it.</p>

      <p>Aside from adventures in New York and Austin, Nick Black is a lifelong ATLien. He began programming on an ATARI 400 sometime during childhood, and with no one
      around to tell him better, developed an idiosyncratic, unorthodox style involving more inline assembly and literary allusions than strictly necessary, or perhaps even justifiable. He has since graduated several times from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and dropped out almost as many times. Approaching forty, he still manages to code about ten hours a day, every day, ideally those free of the Daystar's malignant influence. He hopes to one day destroy the sun.</p>

      <p>Nick exclusively uses black IBM Model-M Trackpoint II M-13 keyboards, and will happily buy any that you might have laying around \textbf{CLACK CLACK CLACK}.</p>
    description: "<p>Nick is currently employed by that notable friend of Free Software,
      Microsoft, where he networks satellites and wrangles high-throughput bits. He
      has previously worked at NVIDIA, Google, and a number of startups. His favorite
      languages, from newest to oldest, are Rust, C, Prolog, and Latin.</p>"

      <p>Around '85, Konrad started as a very young developer using assembler concentrating on game development. The studies of economics and econometrics at the University of Zurich helped him creating very early high frequency trading bots back in the 90s. In 2003 he co-founded Tensid Ltd and created the application "marCo.ch": a cloud-based solution to distribute financial news to wire services and investors all over the world. After they reached market leadership, Konrad and his partner sold Tensid to a larger corporate.</p>

      <p>Konrad decided to dedicate all his time and knowledge to the development of AGPLv3+ software. The project is called "diva.exchange" and its mission is to develop "Free Banking Technology. For Everyone". In a nutshell: DIVA is an I2P-based, highly energy efficient and truly distributed solution enabling everyone to be its very own bank. The non-profit association "diva.exchange" is closely co-operating with academia (next two research projects start in Q1/2021). All works are licensed under AGPLv3+ or compatible.</p>

      Always concerned with questions like "how does it work?" and "how can we make it better?", Nacho loves to share his knowledge with others and at the same time learn from others. As a natural progression to this attitude, he founded the Barcelona Java Users Group ( https://www.barcelonajug.org ) and co-founded the Java and JVM Barcelona Conference ( https://www.jbcnconf.com ).
      When he is not thinking in the next interesting thing to do for the community, he enjoys spending time with his family, playing sports or improving his TDD and eXtreme Programming skills.</p>

      <p>In 2015, he published FastClick, a new version of the Click Modular Router, integrating high-speed I/O framework such as DPDK, along with modern packet processing techniques that led to a modular and flexible NFV framework, still used today by many researchers to prototype various networking designs. To reach 100G networking, he developed Metron to avoid software classification, and offload some processing in hardware switches. He then tackled the problem of load balancing, both inside a server with RSS++ to dispatch packets between the many cores of modern servers, and between multiple servers with Cheetah, a new load-balancer a stateless load-balancer that still allows per-connection load balancing.</p>

      <p>Mike has been using the Tiki.org platform since 2012. While working at an agricultural holding with many separate physical locations he seen the need for increased access to information and reduced repetition. He started with just a few of the most visible features, like the Wiki and File Galleries but quickly progressed to another core feature, Trackers, or databases. Understanding the combined power of these three features and the demand for real-time information, Mike began creating more complex configurations. All the while, not knowing or learning any coding languages or traditional SQL and databases. This led to a much larger project at another farming operation. which, throughout that project, Mike kept referring to himself as a 'one-man-band' not knowing the technical definition was 'Full Stack Developer'.</p>

      <p>Outside of agriculture, some areas in which Mike has completed projects based on Tiki.org, or, helped develop as a team member include: transportation (corporate document delivery), real estate (property management), law (legal case management, incident management and complaint management), corporate training (wiki knowledge center), corporate sales (client database management), HR (employee time and records management, company directory, calendar).</p>

Over the last few years he has focused on function-centric networks to realise distributed and decentralised edge computing, also referred to as “computing in the network”. He held a prestigious EPSRC Early Career Fellowship (2015-2020) in the area of “decentralized content-oriented and service-centric edge-computing architectures”. He has been heavily involved in the effort to shift the Internet towards an Information-Centric Networking environment, which he is now materializing through his contribution to the IPFS Ecosystem.</p>

      he joined MySQL AB in 2001. He was a co-founder of MariaDB Corporation in 2010,
      where he stayed until joining MariaDB Foundation as its CEO in Feb 2019.</p>"

      <p>Kaj Arnö
      CEO</p>

      <p>Kaj is a software industry generalist, having served as VP Professional Services, VP Engineering, CIO and VP Community Relations of MySQL AB prior to the acquisition by Sun Microsystems. At Sun, Kaj served as MySQL Ambassador to Sun and Sun VP of Database Community. Board member at Footbalance Systems Oy (Helsinki, Finland). Past founder, CEO and 14 year main entrepreneur of Polycon Ab (Finland).</p>

      <p>Kaj is a co-founder of MariaDB Corporation Ab, and served on its Executive Team in several positions, most recently Chief Evangelist.</p>

      <p>Kaj lives and works in Munich, Germany, and during summer often in Nagu, Finland. He is a citizen of both countries. Kaj holds a M.Sc. (Eng.) from Helsinki University of Technology (now Aalto University) and an MBA from Hanken School of Economics.</p>

      <p>Programming-wise, Kaj started out on the TI-58 in the 1970s, followed by Basic and a bit of assembler on the ABC-80 and ABC-800, together with Michael “Monty” Widenius. Kaj took fondness to APL on mainframes, before settling on the 4GL Focus as the technical basis for his first company Polycon. After a Visual Basic period, a Delphi period and a brief PHP period, Kaj moved out of programming into management, only to realise in 2011 that Python is good for his mental well-being. His venture into geodata with Python even left some superficial traces on Github.</p>

      <p>Licensing-wise, Kaj contributed to GPLv3 as co-chair of the industry Committee B, advising the FSF on GPLv3 in 2006-07, observing how Eben Moglen led the process towards industry consensus. In 2014, Kaj formalised the Business Source License BSLv1 with its originator Michael Widenius, and made it more mainstream into BSLv1.1 with the help of Bruce Perens and Heather Meeker.</p>

      <p>Language-wise, Kaj is a native Swedish speaker. He also speaks German, English, Finnish and French, and has presented in a number of other languages, including Russian, Japanese, Chinese, and Estonian, mostly understanding what he is saying.</p>

      <p>Kaj joined MariaDB Foundation as CEO on 1 February 2019.</p>

      <p>Senior Software Engineer</p>

      <p>I work on frameworks and architecture to bring joy to developers' lives. Or at least make them that bit easier. Complex problems can have simple solutions, you just need to dig deep enough to find them. I love the elegance of Kotlin, the structured simplicity of Coroutines and the ecosystem changes brought in by Jetpack. Privately I'm raising my daughter in the hope she will one day follow my footsteps into the world of wonder which is modern technology.</p>

    description: |-
      <p>After I got a Commodore C64 when I was in primary school I found my destiny. Basic V2 was my first programming language and many followed after that. This is <strong>very</strong> long ago but I still enjoy doing it. After my successful apprenticeship, I started working professionally in web agency, using the LAMP stack and switched to the dark side (IT consulting and Java) in 2009. Since then, my main focus was the JVM on the backend. I started with classic JEE projects before I finally got set free with the Spring Framework. Lately (well, for nearly 2 years already), I enjoy Kotlin and love using it on the backend.
      Besides all this coding, I also embrace doing infrastructural $things. Since roughly 2014 I use tooling which the industry would call "DevOps tooling", for example Ansible and all kinds of cloudy environments.</p>

      <p>With all this experience I started another exciting journey: being self-employed. Since 2018 I am up for hire as a freelancer and am steadily working on my remote-first IT consultancy steinhauer.software.</p>

      <p>Having participated in some coding workshops by Teckids, the free software youth organisation, I quickly started contributing to tools used there, and throughout time became a core contributor to several educational software projects, Debian Edu and the AlekSIS school information system ranked foremost.</p>

      <p>When not coding or caring for DevOps infrastructure, I enjoy music, going out geocaching sometimes, and travelling the world for fun and for visiting conferences or development sprints.</p>
