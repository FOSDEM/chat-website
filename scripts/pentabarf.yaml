      virtualization and containerization to enable the execution of users‚Äô applications
      in a safer and improved manner. In ToroV, applications run as Virtual Machines
      without the need of an OS, unikernel nor device-model. ToroV combines a minimalist
      Virtual Machine Monitor and a virtualized guest program communicating through
      POSIX APIs. When the guest application requires to open or write a file, it
      just invokes the VMM using hypercalls. The VMM intercepts those hypercalls,
      processes the request, and returns to the guest. The sysadmin defines the ACL
      (Access Control List) of authorized hypercall per virtualized guest application.
      This allows the user to control the host‚Äôs surface that is exposed to the guest.
      In this talk, we propose to present the ToroV architecture together with several
      ongoing experiments. For example, the minimalist VMM allows us to boot up a
      VM in KVM in less than 6 ms. Also, we show how we debug guest applications by
      simply using GDB and the KVM API for debugging. During the talk, we discuss
      the main differences with unikernels and containers and how ToroV gets the best

      <p>DirectFB2 is a fork of DirectFB, a graphics library designed with embedded systems in mind that was widely used in the GNU/Linux embedded world. DirectFB2 comes with changes such as a Meson build system, a pure C implementation and a modularization of the source code.</p>

      <p>Access to the low-level display is based on a DRM/KMS system module (or possibly on a legacy Framebuffer system module), and depending on the platform, hardware-accelerated graphics rendering can be achieved using the architecture of the GFX driver modules.</p>

      <p>The core library is very light (no external dependencies) and provides basic font/image/video rendering support which can be demonstrated with the DirectFB-examples.</p>

      <p>The use of additional DirectFB providers based on external libraries is also possible thanks to the DirectFB-media package, such as rendering fonts with the FreeType library, rendering images with libpng or jpeg libraries, rendering videos with FFmpeg or GStreamer libraries.</p>

      <p>For 3D graphics, OpenGL or Vulkan rendering can be done with the DirectFB graphics backend. As an example, the Mesa 3D implementation makes OpenGL rendering possible with a DirectFBGL module or with EGL for the DirectFB platform, and the SwiftShader implementation makes Vulkan rendering possible with the DirectFB WSI.</p>

      <p>This talk aims at getting started with DirectFB2 which may be worth considering on some devices.</p>

      <p>Venix/86 was the first commercially available Unix for the IBM PC. PC/IX was the first one that IBM supported, but VentureCom created released this port about the time PC/IX was announced. They ported it to a number of the 'near compatible' systems as well, so for many people the first Unix available on those early 8086/8088 machines was Venix. This included the DEC Rainbow 100B with Venix/86R.</p>

      <p>A companion project to recreate the sources for Venix/86 from 7th edition tapes now available was hampered by the slow speed of the DEC Rainbow, so I wrote the emulator to seed that along.</p>

      <p>This talk will be about the emulator's structure, system call interface and portability to other ancient 8088/8086 Unixes. It will also discuss how many of the early ports coped with lack of a MMU in clever ways. It will touch on the path here, and then focus on the current implementation.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The author had a DEC Rainbow which was supported with Venix/86R. By the time the author was employed post college, copies of it had become impossible to find.</p>

      <p>Recently, A copy surfaced and I started working with it. A number of interesting challenges for creating this port will be discussed. I took the hard path to decompile parts of libc to discover the system call interface, and went through a few preliminary implementations of Venix/86 emulation before arriving at what we have today. After the initial decompile, documentation surfaced, other incomplete copies were found along with some source, all of which confirmed most of the details that had been guessed.</p>

      <p>This has been a labor of love for me, using 4 different x86 emulators, a number of deep searches online to find as much info as I can, disassembly, etc. I'll touch on some of these aspects as well. It's currently running using vm86 on a FreeBSD/i386 bhyve instance hosted on a FreeBSD/amd64 machine nicely... A port to qemu user-* might be possible too.</p>

      <p>This goes hand in hand with another project: recreate the sources that can create a Venix kernel using the now-available 7th Edition sources, which may be a future submission.</p>

    raw_abstract: |-
      <p>Venix/86 was the first commercially available Unix for the IBM PC. PC/IX was the first one that IBM supported, but VentureCom created released this port about the time PC/IX was announced. They ported it to a number of the 'near compatible' systems as well, so for many people the first Unix available on those early 8086/8088 machines was Venix. This included the DEC Rainbow 100B with Venix/86R.</p>

      <p>A companion project to recreate the sources for Venix/86 from 7th edition tapes now available was hampered by the slow speed of the DEC Rainbow, so I wrote the emulator to seed that along.</p>

      <p>This talk will be about the emulator's structure, system call interface and portability to other ancient 8088/8086 Unixes. It will also discuss how many of the early ports coped with lack of a MMU in clever ways. It will touch on the path here, and then focus on the current implementation.</p>
    raw_description: |-
      <p>The author had a DEC Rainbow which was supported with Venix/86R. By the time the author was employed post college, copies of it had become impossible to find.</p>

      <p>Recently, A copy surfaced and I started working with it. A number of interesting challenges for creating this port will be discussed. I took the hard path to decompile parts of libc to discover the system call interface, and went through a few preliminary implementations of Venix/86 emulation before arriving at what we have today. After the initial decompile, documentation surfaced, other incomplete copies were found along with some source, all of which confirmed most of the details that had been guessed.</p>

      <p>This has been a labor of love for me, using 4 different x86 emulators, a number of deep searches online to find as much info as I can, disassembly, etc. I'll touch on some of these aspects as well. It's currently running using vm86 on a FreeBSD/i386 bhyve instance hosted on a FreeBSD/amd64 machine nicely... A port to qemu user-* might be possible too.</p>

      <p>This goes hand in hand with another project: recreate the sources that can create a Venix kernel using the now-available 7th Edition sources, which may be a future submission.</p>

      <p>Software development has been gradually shifting from monolithic to distributed containerized applications. Such applications are composed of components referred to as micro services.
      With the increasing number of micro services, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand how all the components communicate.</p>

      <p>This is where Istio service mesh comes into play. Istio allows developers to manage and monitor network traffic between micro services and by providing features like mutual TLS, request retries or request circuit breaking. Vendoring these features from Istio helps keeping micro services focused on the actual application logic as they don't need to be implemented by the micro services.
      The IT industry has broadly adopted this architecture, but there are still plenty of legacy workloads running in virtual machines, which can't easily take the advantage of the features provided by service mesh. At least not until recently when KubeVirt introduced support for Istio service mesh.</p>

      <p>Attendees of this talk gain insight into the concept of the Istio sidecar proxy. A short demonstration showing typical use case of Istio service mesh -- canary deployment -- is presented. Next, this talk explains subtle differences of network traffic routing between regular Kubernetes pods and containerized KubeVirt virtual machines, leading to the challenges that these differences pose for traffic proxying.
      Finally, the changes necessary to support Istio for KubeVirt virtual machines are explained and the resulting functionality presented using the same scenario, but with the workload running in virtual machines instead of Kubernetes Pods.</p>

      <p>The takeaway of this talk is understanding of routing concepts behind Istio proxy sidecar with regular Kubernetes pods as well as with containerized KubeVirt virtual machines. Audience will have a chance to observe typical use case of Istio with both pods and virtual machines and get insight into the necessary changes that made this possible.</p>

      <p>Such a project has a lot of interesting challenges but in this talk, only the technical aspects will be introduced. The perspective and the journey of the editor of the book will be demonstrated, whose responsibility was to combine the chapters written by three different authors into a single, ready-to-print document.</p>

      <p>The main tools were LibreOffice Writer and Draw but GIMP and InkScape also played a significant role.</p>

      <p>In the talk, various tricks and steps will be shown how the document has been created and how the different tools were able to cooperate. Besides the working ways, some non-working paths and traps also will be shown.</p>

      <p>The pervasiveness of Edge computing and Service Mesh constructs within a cloud native environment have almost been at the same time during last few years. Requirements of Edge compute to be able to unify both Information &amp; Communication Technology (ICT) and Operational Technology (OT) have brought together cloud native deployments and microservice based service offerings to the Edge infrastructure]. While Kubernetes been the most popular model of deploying cloud native infrastructure to offer software services, service mesh is the emergent application deployment paradigm that decouples application from developing most of the software defined networking aspects of microservice interactions. This paper introduces features of service mesh that are architecturally suitable for Edge compute service offerings and application development principles. To understand applicability of service mesh, architectural principles need to be understood to figure out suitability of various benefits mesh benefits to customized Edge deployments. This talk introduces and correlates various Edge requirements to the service mesh‚Äôs architectural guidelines. Then further dig into deployment considerations of service mesh with Edge deployment types to provide practical communication challenges between the two. This talk:
      - Provides benchmark tests and their results that provides the impact of service mesh on simple Kubernetes based deployments using Istio &amp; Envoy as service mesh and its sidecar proxy, that can be leveraged for Edge environments.
      - Provides detailed analysis of the software used to identify bottlenecks using Top-Down Microarchitectural Analysis and CPU Hot Spot analysis.
      - Summarizes the gaps identified during the detailed testing of these open-source components
      - Showcases the impact of utilizing service mesh for edge computing.</p>

      <p>An overview of Java projects running on the Raspberry Pi.</p>

      <p>In 2021 the Pi4J project released a completely new second version of its object-oriented GPIO API and implementation library for the Raspberry Pi. Let's take a look at the new documentation site and example projects to get you started with Java development on the Raspberry Pi.</p>
    description: <p>Getting started with Java in a new area - like controlling electronic
      components - can be challenging, but the Pi4J project aims to make this an easy
      and fun experience. Thanks to a lot of getting-started tutorials and example
      projects, different use-cases are handled. The experience of your first "blinking
      LED" is a really amazing experience for a lot of software developers who never
      interfaced with electronics before. In this presentation, we will take a look
      at a few of these examples.</p>

    abstract: <p>SPARKNaCl is a new, verified and fast reefrence implementation of
      the NaCl API, based on the TweetNaCl distribution. It has a fully automated,
      complete and sound proof of type-safety and several key correctness properties.
      In addition, the code is fast - out-performing TweetNaCl on an Ed25519 Sign
      operation by a factor of 3 at all optimization levels. This talk will cover
      how "Proof Driven Optimization" can result in code that is both correct and
      fast on bare-metal embedded targets.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>TweetNaCl is a compact reference implementation of the NaCl API. It was initially
      constructed to show that an entire crypto library could fit into "100 tweets", but has
      since been re-used in some critical applications, such as the WireGuard VPN.
      There are no comments in the code at all, and all assurance rests on a single brief
      academic paper, and the formidable reputation of the authors.</p>

      <p>Can we do better? Can we produce a reference implementation which is amenable to
      automatic verification and yet is competitive with TweetNaCl in terms of performance and code
      size?</p>

      <p>This talk presents SPARKNaCl - a complete re-implementation of
      TweetNaCl in SPARK, which comes with a fully automated proof of type-safety,
      memory-safety and a number of key correctness properties.
      Having established a solid foundation, we went on to compare the performance and code size of
      SPARKNaCl against the original C implementation. Various transformations and optimizations
      have been applied that result in SPARKNaCl out-performing TweetNaCl
      on a bare-metal 32-bit RISC-V machine for a single Ed25519 "Sign" operation,
      while retaining automation and completeness of the proof. Furthermore, SPARKNaCl is freely available under the 3-clause BSD licence.</p>

      proof work and performance analysis of SPARKNaCl.</p>

      <p>Hellschreiber is a morse-like graphical transmission of digital data reminiscent of fax over wireless communication media designed in the 1930s and used during the second world war by the German military. Now used by the ham radio community, we consider how hellschreiber is emitted using a Raspberry Pi GPIO pin configured as radiofrequency emitter, an approach made popular by rpitx and generalized to GNU Radio with our gr-rpitx OOT sink block (https://github.com/jmfriedt/gr-rpitx). The transmitted signal is recorded by a RTL-SDR DVB-T receiver and decoded using gr-hellschreiber (https://github.com/tlavarenne/gr-hellschreiber).
      Preparing this presentation was an opportunity to become familiar with GNU Radio 3.9 and the presentation concludes with some of the challenges (and solutions) met when porting gr-acars
      (https://sourceforge.net/projects/gr-acars/) to this new version of the signal processing framework.</p>

      <p>In 1982, David Horne wrote a version of chess which managed to fit inside the memory of a 1K ZX81. Although it wasn't a complete implementation, it was impressive enough to be remembered now, almost 40 years later. But running it in 2022 requires at least an emulator, ROM file, and the .P file, which limits the appeal to retro enthusiasts and excludes the intended audience - chess players!</p>

      <p>So, I modified the EMF emulator (and the game) to run as an emulator-as-a-service, so that it can be played via the lichess servers with a modern web-friendly interface.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>In this talk I'll cover a brief history of the program, how the emulator was modified, how the program was reverse engineered and understood, how this code connects to the lichess server and, most crucially, why someone would do it!</p>

      <p>Along the way we'll look at the chess notation, FEN, Z80 assembler, NDJSON, and a few other pieces to show you the complete puzzle fits together.</p>

      <p>In biomedical sciences, ontologies are used to annotate and organize data stored in knowledge databases and facilitate their exploitation. Following the pioneering work of the Gene Ontology at the turn of the century, the Open Biomedical and Biological Ontologies (OBO) Foundry was created to coordinate the development of a family of interoperable ontologies sharing a core set of principles. The Foundry now includes more than 150 ontologies.
      The Ontology Development Kit (ODK) [1] was developed to facilitate the implementation of standardized ontology development practices across the Foundry. It takes the form of a Docker image that provides ontology editors with all the command-line tools they need to manage, edit, build, and test their ontologies, as well as standardized and carefully crafted Makefile rules to pilot all steps of the ontology life cycle. In recent years, many ontologies such as the Uberon multi-species anatomy ontology, the Cell Ontology (CL), or the Unified Phenotype Ontology (uPheno) have been converted to use the ODK. By moving most of the management, building, and testing logic from the individual ontologies to the ODK, the kit aims to make the life of ontology editors easier, by allowing them to focus solely on actual ontology editing, all the while contributing to the standardisation of the various ontologies.</p>

      <p>You need a lot of hubris to design your own programming language.  As a result, new languages are often engineered (or "over-engineered") for that glorious future where millions of programmers spend their lives working with the language, and a small army is maintaining the compiler and related tools.  But how would you design a language that assumes this bountiful future will never arrive?  A language that, even in the best of circumstances, will always be obscure and secondary?  Futhark is a programming language designed for a very specific domain: high-level, deterministic, data-parallel number crunching.  It explicitly disavows general-purpose use, and it is absolutely not possible to write full applications in it.  Thus, even if Futhark somehow managed to become the largest conceivable success and completely dominate its domain, that would not translate into very many programmers.  And even then, it would at best be a secondary or third language for most of its users.</p>

      <p>In this talk I will talk about how such a perspective has affected the design of the Futhark language and its tools.  To a first approximation, this is just the "principle of least surprise" applied to every part of the language and ecosystem.  As a niche language, Futhark's novelty budget is quite limited, and its users will not have the inclination to learn about syntactical subtleties, elaborate package managers or build systems.  At the same time, it's trying to innovate in a challenging domain, so some things definitely will have to be novel.  Balancing these concerns has been interesting, and my experiences are perhaps even useful for designers of languages, tools, or systems in similar situations.</p>

      <p>Wouldn‚Äôt it be great to be able to dabble with Kubernetes, Calico, BGP, and WireGuard in a totally safe, totally zero-cost, and easily (!!) reproducible local laptop or workstation environment?</p>

      <p>If you agree, I‚Äôm here for you. In this engaging, hands-on and fun session I‚Äôll share with you how I built two four-node Kubernetes clusters, peering with BGP, forwarding with WireGuard, all inside my laptop, and how you can do the same, for fun, learning, and profit. Or, well, just fun and learning, actually.</p>

      <p>When working with these technologies (especially BGP), cost, risk and complexity are the usual barriers to learning. Let's remove them and get back to enjoying our learning.</p>

      <p>Inaugural secure enclave platforms operate at the single user process level (e.g. SGX), meaning a single address space with potentially multiple threads, with a standard OS outside the enclave responsible for resource management and scheduling. More recent platforms (AMD SEV, Intel TDX, AWS Nitro Enclaves) operate at the VM level. This provides significant new capabilities for multi-process abstractions such as mmap and fork, which will be beneficial for enclavizing legacy software.</p>

      <p>However, taking a VM image and running it in an enclave is not great from a TCB minimization standpoint. For platforms where there's currently no alternative (AMD, AWS), how can we build--with a minimal TCB--an abstraction that's similar to single-process enclaves? Of course you can ‚Äújust run Linux‚Äù with a single process but this again is clearly suboptimal. We'll explore the solution space in this interactive session.</p>

      <p>This presentation intends to illustrate how MetaindeX opensource application could match a significant part of user needs, especially in the fields of history and humanities.
      It first defines an overview of what user requirements could be for a working environment offering a ready-to-use, coding-free, quick and efficient access to advanced exploration, analytics and graphs capabilities over an historical data corpus for the researcher. It supposes that input data has already been collected, cleaned and reconciled, focusing on the exploration and analytics parts of researcher workflow.
      In a second part, it then develops those needs through key technologies and architecture choices made for design and development of online open-source application MetaindeX [1].
      At last, a sample use-case illustrates user experience and shows some analytics results from the use of MetaindeX and its ecosystem (Kibana and Gephi mainly), based on a set of French archives from 16th and 17th century.</p>

    description: |-
      <p>Mobian started as a collection of hacks and scripts for running Debian on the PinePhone. Initially published as "Debian+Phosh" on the PINE64 forum, all packages were manually (cross) compiled and uploaded to the developer's personal web server.</p>

      <p>Over time, it gathered a strong community of users and developers and ultimately gained recognition from the wider mobile Linux community, to the point where it partnered with PINE64 to release a "Mobian Community Edition" PinePhone. Over the course of its 2 years of existence, the project implemented tools to ease development and automate deployment, and added support for more mobile devices, such as Purism's Librem 5, but also Surface Pro tablets and a few Android phones such as the OnePlus 6 and Pocophone F1.</p>

      <p>This talk will walk you through those 2 years of development, highlighting the project's contributions to the (mobile) FLOSS ecosystem. We will also emphasize how its members work, as part of the DebianOnMobile team, towards its ultimate goal of becoming irrelevant by making Debian a reference distribution on mobile devices. Finally, we will give you an update on the project's current status and plans.</p>

      <p>Working with Big Data means that we need tools to organise and understand the data. And you don‚Äôt have to be a developer to search, aggregate and visualise your data. Whether you need an affordable business analytics tool or you want to analyse log data in near real time, OpenSearch can help you. And all of it through a visual interface of OpenSearch Dashboards.</p>

      <p>After listening to this talk you‚Äôll understand the basics of working with an OpenSearch cluster and different use cases it supports. You‚Äôll also learn to create your first search and aggregation query and visualise the outcomes with the help of OpenSearch Dashboards.</p>

      <p>In the modern app architecture, Frontend contributes a major chunk of the setup, most of the business logic is housed in the Frontend. Over time Frontend app becomes a huge monolith, harder to maintain, trickier to add new features, and so on. With Microfrontends we break this monolith into smaller independent apps. These apps are developed independently but stitched as a SPA on the fly with all the goodies of client-side javascript. This has been done traditionally with several approaches, but with Webpack 5 we now have Module Federation, which opens the door for seamless MicroFrontend integrations.
      In this talk, we will discuss the Microfrontends architecture pattern, how to destructure an existing monolith into MicroFrontends with help of Module Federation from Webpack 5. By the end of this talk, the attendees will be having a new vision of how they architect their Frontends.</p>

      <p>The creation of a positioning system has use cases for indoor, outdoor and even small-scale deployments. These solutions often use a broad range of technologies and algorithms that each have their advantages as well as limitations. Existing open source positioning solutions often offer a complete package for indoor navigation or asset tracking that allows developers to set up a specific application with minimal effort. However, these positioning solutions offer little room for developers to customise them.</p>

      <p>OpenHPS is an open source hybrid positioning framework for creating a positioning system without being bound to a specific technology or a set of algorithms. Developers are free to choose the data they want to use, from where they want to obtain this data, how to process the data and finally how to use the outcome of the positioning system. In this presentation we will present the modularity and ecosystem around the OpenHPS framework, some technical aspects as well as the current state of the project.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>A localisation system often has use cases such as tracking employees or navigating people at a conference. When looking at the problem in a more broader
      perspective the use cases often span way beyond the tracking and navigation of people. Whether it is a use case where pawns need to be tracked on chessboard or
      a robot needs to navigate itself outside and through multiple buildings, different approaches need to be used.</p>

      <p>Using use case specific software development kits would be an easy solution for developers, but with the constantly changing technologies and algorithms these different platforms cause a fragmentation
      of knowledge over multiple programming languages and hardware. Being created in TypeScript, the framework can be deployed on a variety of devices while making use of the large number of packages that are available. A process network design is used to process data from a source to sink. The processing can be done locally, remote and even distributed over multiple processes, web workers or remote machines. Each part of the process network is modular, allowing developers to share algorithms that will be compatible with the same data structure used throughout the framework. In addition, this process network design allows existing algorithms in different programming languages to be accessed as 'part of the processing'.</p>

      <p>With the OpenHPS project we want to create an ecosystem of modules that each focus on a specific aspect in the creation of a positioning system. Modules for different storage techniques, remote communication, computer vision and different sensor sources already exist that will be further discussed in the current state part of the presentation. At its core, the framework is aimed towards developers that have a basic understanding of implementing a positioning system by means of combining parts of the process network. This method of development allows the rapid prototyping of a complete positioning system that can later on be deployed in a production environment.</p>

      <p>Future work in the project will create additional layers of abstraction that allows the development of a system without the required knowledge of the algorithms. However, because the framework is still modular at its core, these abstractions will still allow developers to tweak the system to do the task it is designed to do.</p>

      <p>Failure is an inevitable part of success. Failure in the context of innovation efforts has helped  thousands of start-up companies to succeed but in the context of a known execution process, it can harm results or reputations or create undue risk.

    title: Self-sovereign end-to-end encrypted file storage on Matrix
    subtitle: How we built a file system on top of Matrix

      <p>Matrix is an open source project run by the non-profit Matrix.org Foundation dedicated to building an open protocol and communication network for decentralised, encrypted communication - providing a viable open alternative to WhatsApp, Slack, Discord and other proprietary communication silos.</p>

      <p>During 2021 we have been exploring how the Matrix protocol can be used for decentralised, end-to-end encrypted online document storage and collaboration as an alternative to centralised proprietary services such as Dropbox and Box. In this talk we will show off our progress so far and the further work that we have planned.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Matrix is essentially a generic mechanism for replicating structured data over a decentralised network of untrusted servers.  The first use cases of Matrix have focused on instant messaging and VoIP, but during 2021 we‚Äôve been experimenting with replicating different types of structured data - such as MSC3089 (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/travis/msc/trees/proposals/3089-file-tree-structures.md), which models each Matrix room as a directory, which can contain subdirectories by acting as a Matrix Space, which in turn can contain files as normal Matrix file uploads described by appropriate state events.  We‚Äôve also been looking at further expressing the file data as structured trees of Matrix events.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the need for self-sovereign file-storage and collaboration systems is growing ever more obvious, given the risks of trusting your data unilaterally to a proprietary and typically unencrypted 3rd party cloud service. However, there is currently a trade off between the typical productivity gains from non-privacy centric online collaboration versus the more limited pro-privacy solutions currently available.</p>

      <p>Can Matrix support the next generation of privacy-centric collaboration applications? Providing document and file storage capabilities is one of the areas we‚Äôre looking at.</p>

      <p>Topics that we will cover:
      * File and folder semantics
      * Version history
      * Sharing and access control
      * Document editing
      * Use cases: demos
      * Matrix protocol specification work to standardise approach and support interoperability
      * Files SDK for JavaScript to make it easy to get started
      * Next steps</p>

      <p>In this talk, we'll understand how PostgreSQL recursive queries can help. Starting from the proper problem definition, we'll then explore how to build queries that call themselves recursively, what are the risks associated with this approach and safeguards we can set to optimise performances. Finally we'll demonstrate how two new features released in PostgreSQL 14 enable an easier handling of the recursive statements.</p>

      <p>The cloud-native approach based on containerized micro-services has transformed the software landscape but is largely focused on non-real time web-based applications, especially in the case of service meshes which use web proxies to interconnect workloads.  Media Streaming Mesh uses real-time media proxies to observe, route, encrypt and protect north-south and east-west media traffic.</p>

      <p>This talk introduces the Media Streaming Mesh architecture and its use-cases, gives an update on implementation status, and acts as a call to arms to recruit more contributors.</p>

      <p>Claude Warren will present an overview of his recent work to implementing multidimensional Bloom filters.  This talk will focus on the implementation of the multidimensional Bloom filters, their current use in modern software, and how they are applicable as a multi-column index, an index into large document collections, or an index to encrypted data.  The talk will briefly describe Bloom filters and their construction before discussing strategies for the management of multiple Bloom filters; also known as multidimensional Bloom filters.  Data from a comparative analysis of several multidimensional Bloom filter strategies will be presented along with discussion of when to select one implementation over another.</p>

      <p>As a programming language, Ada offers a number of features that require runtime support, e.g. exception propagation or concurrency (tasks, protected objects). The GNAT compiler implements this support in its runtime library, which comes in a number of different flavors, with more or less capability. The GNAT light runtime library is a version of the runtime library targeted at embedded platforms and certification, with an Operating System or without it (baremetal). It contains around 180 units focused mostly on I/O, numerics, text manipulation, memory operations.</p>

      <p>Variants of the GNAT light runtime library have been certified for use at the highest levels of criticality in several industrial domains: avionics (DO-178), space (ECSS-E-ST40C), railway (EN 50128), automotive (ISO-26262). Details vary across certification regimes, but the common approach to certification used today is based on written requirements traced to corresponding tests, supported by test coverage analysis. Despite this strict certification process, some bugs were found in the past in the code. An ongoing project at AdaCore is applying formal proof with SPARK to the light runtime units, in order to prove their correctness: that the code is free of runtime errors, and that it satisfies its functional specifications.</p>

      <p>So far, 30 units (out of 180) have been proved, and a few bugs fixed along the way (including a security vulnerability). In this talk, I will describe the approach followed, what was achieved, and what we expect to achieve.</p>

      <p>Both software-defined radio and FPGA are interesting. Especially, the combination of AD936X RF transceiver and ZYNQ 7020 level FPGA SoC is capable of running openwifi. Price has been keeping average DIYers away from this kind of platform as evaluation boards from ADI and Xilinx are both extremely expensive. Cheaper ones like ANTSDR exist, but seems all of them have tied the RF and ZYNQ chip together, so these are not suitable for generic ZYNQ development anymore.</p>

      <p>In this talk, I want to introduce an openwifi capable low-cost AD936X extension board design and realization for the wildly available PYNQ-Z1 board by Digilent. This provides openwifi and PlutoSDR functionalities meanwhile keeping the major if not all functions of PYNQ-Z1 intact, with summed price potentially lower than all currently available openwifi capable platforms. Similar designs may also be applicable to other ZYNQ boards like ZYBO Z7-20 or Arty Z7-20, thus these could make openwifi available to much more people, especially those who already have a ZYNQ board. Besides this extension board, I'll also touch on tools and workflows for "modern" circuit board DIY, which enabled me to build this 4-layer board with BGA chip comfortably at home.</p>

      <p>Modern network security and monitoring applications need to analyse traffic efficiently in streaming fashion (i.e. while traffic is flowing). This is in order to detect interesting traffic patterns in realtime without dumping data on a database and performing computationally expensive queries in batches. Many network developers do not have skills for efficiently analyse traffic, and data scientists often do not have skills to understand the complex nature of network traffic. For this reason nDPI, a popular open-source deep packet inspection library, has been enhanced with various algorithms and techniques that dramatically simplify traffic analysis and that should ease the creation of applications able to efficiently spot traffic patterns and anomalies.
      This talk will introduce some of these algorithms present in nDPI and show how they can be used in real-life at high-speed, contrary to many applications that are inefficient and often based on languages (e.g. Python and R) that are not designed to analyse traffic in streaming at 10 Gbit+ on commodity hardware.</p>

      <p>OKD Virtualization is the community project bringing traditional virtualization technology into OKD. It‚Äôs built on top of the KubeVirt project and the Hyperconverged Cluster Operator project.
      HCO ensures a single installable unit for Kubevirt and its sibling components leveraging the operator framework to provide the easiest way of installing and maintaining this additional control plane.
      This bundle will ship additional tools required to do traditional virtualization tasks like uploading disk images, host network configuration, local storage provisioning, and other functionality which is not covered by the core KubeVirt. On top of this a user interface embedded within the OKD Console is provided for managing the lifecycle of the Virtual Machines. Virtual Machines from other virtualization systems can be imported into OKD Virtualization leveraging the Konveyor Forklift project. Meet the OKD Virtualization community and learn about it!</p>

      <p><a href="https://fd.io/">VPP</a> (Vector Packet Processing) is a fast network stack running in Linux userspace.
      It is designed to handle packets with high performance, which makes gathering statistics efficiently a must have.</p>

      <p>The model that has been chosen in VPP to provide up to date statistics is built upon shared memory and optimistic locking.
      The counters are updated in this shared memory at a rather low cost by the data plane and can be read out at almost any time by all the consumers.
      We will first describe this model in more details.</p>

      <p>The consumption of these stats may take various forms depending on the use case and the application needs.
      That's why we have developed different high-level components to access them:
      1) A filesystem in userspace: thanks to <a href="https://github.com/hanwen/go-fuse">go-fuse</a>, we can mount a filesystem ordering statistics in folders and files, in a similar fashion to '/proc' in Linux
      2) A <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> agent: applied to Calico/VPP, a new dataplane for Calico - the popular cloud native Kubernetes network plugin - based on VPP.
        Prometheus is integrated as a monitoring tool in order to export our statistics in the form of real-time metrics collected from targets.
        Metrics come from our pod interfaces statistics, and targets are Calico/VPP agents running on our Kubernetes cluster nodes.
      During the presentation, you will have a quick demo of these components.</p>

      <p>Open Source Geotechnologies are developed using various socio-technical systems. Understanding of these systems can help us understand the genealogy of the data generation. There are various applications that transcend from the basic understanding of geospatial as technological systems. I am analyzing OpenStreetMap and trying to define its digital spaces to understand what forms of plurality exist in data production. Conceptualization of Digital spaces of OpenStreetMap is important in order to visualise how we can define ethical boundaries and to answer the underlying question of ‚Äúwhat is quality?‚Äù. I am currently interviewing, sending out questionnaires to OpenStreetMap users and conducting texture analysis of previous conference talks related to OpenStreetMap. In this talk I would like to present my ongoing progress on the research project OSM Utopia and present the small part in which I would like to increase the support from different researchers and practitioners, which is conceptualizing OpenStreetMap digital spaces.
      Furthermore, In this talk I explain how I planned to explore the interconnection and interdependence of analogue and digital spatiality of OSM and different research paradigms that needed to be explored. Also, will share the current progress on the way of defining digital spaces of OpenStreetMap and how we can categorise different analogues and digital assemblages that form these digital spaces. Limitations of these methods are also addressed. End goal that is targeted is that the data quality for OpenStreetMap requires a certain level of rethinking.</p>

      <p>Voyager 1 is the furthest spacecraft and the first ever to exit the solar system. Fueled by its radioisotope generators, after more than 40 years of flight it is still sending us data about the interstellar medium using its 3.7 metre dish antenna and 8.4 GHz transmitter. In this talk we report two adventures regarding the reception of the Voyager 1 signal.</p>

      <p>In the first part, we show the successful detection of the Voyager 1 signal using one of the 6.1 metre dishes at the Allen Telescope Array in November 2020. Calculations show that using stable frequency references and accurate Doppler correction, this feat might also be possible for amateurs with smaller dishes if they integrate several hours of data to pull out the very weak signal from the noise. In the second part, we use some recordings done by the 100 metre Green Bank Telescope in 2015 and 2020 to decode the data transmitted by Voyager 1. The spacecraft predates the modern CCSDS standards, so its data has some interesting aspects.</p>

      <p>All this work has been done using GNU Radio, Python, and other open source tools. The data and results are publicly available.</p>

      <p>Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC) produce less than 10% of the world's scientific output, largely relying on solutions devised in the Global North, which are often unable to meet the real needs of their population. Data science and machine learning offer a unique opportunity to empower scientists in LMIC by providing cost-effective tools ideal for underfunded settings, but there is a gap in accessibility, infrastructure and skills that must be bridged before these tools can be effectively implemented.
      We are developing the Ersilia Model Hub, a FLOSS platform where scientists can browse through a catalogue of AI/ML models and run them without the need to write a single line of code. The platform features both models published in the literature and models developed by us on-demand or in collaboration with researchers in LMIC. The pilot tool focuses on models for drug discovery in infectious and neglected tropical diseases, but we plan to expand to other global health.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The Ersilia Model Hub is currently in alpha development, and it will be released in January 2022, containing 100 models. The MVP must be downloaded in the user‚Äôs computers and is accessible via a command-line interface. The models are fetched from our GitHub repository and run locally. They are designed to perform on regular personal computers. In the next phases, an online query system will be implemented for the most popular models, together with a user-friendly interface which does not require use of the CLI.
      In addition, we are working towards an end-to-end automated AI/ML pipeline to facilitate the creation and implementation of models trained on specific datasets of relevance to each of our users. This package will also be available early 2022.</p>

Data science and machine learning offer a unique opportunity to empower scientists in LMIC by providing cost-effective tools ideal for underfunded settings, but there is a gap in accessibility, infrastructure and skills that must be bridged before these tools can be effectively implemented.
      We are developing the Ersilia Model Hub, a FLOSS platform where scientists can browse through a catalogue of AI/ML models and run them without the need to write a single line of code. The platform features both models published in the literature and models developed by us on-demand or in collaboration with researchers in LMIC. The pilot tool focuses on models for drug discovery in infectious and neglected tropical diseases, but we plan to expand to other global health.</p>
    raw_description: |-
      <p>The Ersilia Model Hub is currently in alpha development, and it will be released in January 2022, containing 100 models. The MVP must be downloaded in the user‚Äôs computers and is accessible via a command-line interface. The models are fetched from our GitHub repository and run locally. They are designed to perform on regular personal computers. In the next phases, an online query system will be implemented for the most popular models, together with a user-friendly interface which does not require use of the CLI.
      In addition, we are working towards an end-to-end automated AI/ML pipeline to facilitate the creation and implementation of models trained on specific datasets of relevance to each of our users. This package will also be available early 2022.</p>

      <p>Network Automation has evolved a lot on the last years, adopting a lot of the practices from SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) but with the intrinsic constraint of networking services. In this talk you will learn about which are the challenges and common use cases around network automation, for instance: configuration management, user-driven workflows, infrastructure as Code (for hybrid and multi clouds) or close-loop automation using Telemetry.
      You will realise how a lot of open source projects are coming together to provide solutions to the previous challenges from different angles and how you could connect them together to start building a network automation strategy that could transform your network with lower OPEX, improved reliability and security, and increased innovation.</p>

      <p>Sudo is used by millions to control and log administrator access to systems, but using only the default configuration, there are plenty of blind spots. Using the latest features in sudo lets you watch some functions that previously were blind spots and you can also control access to them. There were several minor and major changes since the 1.9.0 release that I discussed in my previous FOSDEM talks. Here are the four major new features allowing you see your blind spots:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>instead of giving full shell access, you can fine-tune the working directory and chroot settings</p></li>
      <li><p>JSON-formatted logs give you more details on events and are easier to act on</p></li>
      <li><p>relays in sudo_logsrvd make session recording collection more secure and reliable</p></li>
      <li><p>you can log and control sub-commands executed by the command that is run through sudo</p></li>
      </ul>
    description: |-
      <p>Previously, there were quite a few situations where you had to give users full shell access through sudo. Typical examples are when you run a command from a given directory, or run commands in a chroot environment. You can now configure the working directory or the chroot directory and give access only to the command the user really needs.</p>

      <p>Logging is one of the main roles of sudo, to see who did what on the system. Using JSON-formatted log messages gives you even more information about events. Also, structured logs are easier to act on. Setting up alerting for suspicious events is much easier when you have a single parser to configure for any kind of sudo logs. You can collect sudo logs not only by local syslog, but also by using sudo_logsrvd, the same application used to collect session recordings.</p>

      <p>Speaking of session recordings: instead of using a single central server, you can now have multiple levels of sudo_logsrvd relays between the client and the final destination. This allows session collection even if the central server is unavailable, providing you with additional security. It also makes your network configuration simpler.</p>

      <p>Finally, you can log sub-commands executed from the command issued through sudo. You can see commands started from a shell. No more unnoticed shell access from text editors. And, best of all: you can also intercept sub-commands.</p>

      <p>Emulation of classic hardware is a solved problem and like all solved problems that are sufficiently fun it attracts countless new implementations every year. This has led to the creation of many public test suites ‚Äî test suites independent of any particular emulator, which can usually even run on real hardware. But these suites tend to assume a lot of working functionality beyond the part they are specifically testing, being designed by an intelligent human being to test complete emulators holistically.</p>

      <p>This presentation covers an alternative source and target of emulator tests: random numbers, to test individual processor instructions, so that future emulator authors can test from day one.</p>

      <p>Garage is a new storage system for building geo-distributed storage clusters.¬†Garage is developped by Deuxfleurs, an experimental self-hosting collective.</p>

      <p>Garage targets primarily home-grown clusters composed of second-hand commodity hardware, spread over multiple physical locations for redundancy. This deployment scenario implies strong constraints on the software, such as having to deal with slow nodes and high latency between nodes. In a fist part of this talk, we will show how Garage's design enables it to function very well in this scenario, contrarily to other solutions we have tested such as Minio or Glusterfs.</p>

      <p>Garage is focused on implementing the Amazon S3 protocol, a de-facto standard that makes it directly usable as a storage backend for many web applications (such as Nextcloud) or as a backup target. A second part of this talk will be focused on showing how Garage integrates with Deuxfleurs' current self-hosting stack, and how it can be easily configured with a variety of applications.</p>

      While a couple commercial and open-source solutions exist to solve this problem, they all call for a separate set of tools, skills and limitations along with hardstop from CISO and Security Architect.

    description: |-
      <p>While there are significant efforts to improve Kubernetes component layers, the state of Secret Management is not receiving much interests.
      Using etcd to store API object definition &amp; states, Kubernetes secrets are encoded in Base64 and shipped into the key value store database. Even if the filesystems on which etcd runs are encrypted, the secrets are still not.</p>

      <p>Once deployed, Trousseau will enable seamless secret management using the native Kubernetes API and kubectl CLI usage while leveraging an existing Key Management Service (KMS) provider.

      <p>Concurrent code is hard to get right, but at the same time also hard to test. It gets worse when hardware interaction is required. This leads to a comparatively poor culture of unit testing in kernel code, where both come together.</p>

      <p>In this talk, I‚Äôm going to highlight one particular method of unit testing the page table manipulation code in Hedron, a microkernel written in C++ specially geared towards virtualization workloads. This code safely modifies page tables that are concurrently used by the CPU. Usually, unit tests only check whether the state after an operation meets the expectation of the programmer. In contrast, Hedron employs completely deterministic unit tests that show that the CPU will always see a valid virtual memory mappings while a page table manipulation is in progress (for the tested cases).</p>

      <p>The goal of this task is to show that unit tests can be a powerful tool even for properties of code that are usually not deemed unit testable.</p>

      <p>Recognizing community members is one of the most enjoyable activities for community managers. It is a great opportunity to thank people for their work and highlight their contributions to the rest of the community. However, we need to evaluate if we‚Äôre truly being inclusive with our community recognitions. For example, when discussing contributors, we still see a lot of emphasis on the volume of contributions on project repositories (i.e., code) that some may find intimidating. This focus on code is partly because contributions on tools like GitHub and GitLab are easier to measure and quantify.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, it can be more challenging to measure (or even notice) how much a community member is helping others on platforms like Discord, Matrix, Slack, etc. When someone helps a newcomer by answering a quick question in chat, it‚Äôs easy to miss that among other discussion threads. Even though it can be more challenging to quantify non-code contributions, it‚Äôs crucial to look beyond repositories to see how people are helping to improve our communities. In addition to contributions in chat-like platforms, this can include sharing their use cases, participating in meetups, providing honest feedback in 1-on-1 conversations, etc. Looking across a broad spectrum of contributions will help ensure that we recognize everyone regardless of their background, interests, and skillset.</p>

      <p>Also, not everyone is comfortable with public recognition. Some may feel uncomfortable being in the spotlight or even think what they have done is not significant enough (sometimes I see this with contributors from underrepresented groups). In these instances, it is important to find ways to let them know that the community appreciates their work without putting them in an awkward position.</p>

      <p>In this talk, Ray will share his experience identifying different contributions, community recognition examples (both good and bad), and feedback he received on community recognition programs. There will also be a discussion on how inclusive recognition is vital for strengthening the sense of belonging in the community.</p>

      <p>Compilers play a crucial role in hardening software against security attacks. As compiler engineers we experience an increase in demand for security-related features: we simply work on security-related features more often.
      We find it tough to analyze whether the hardenings we implement are easy or hard to circumvent by attackers. After chatting about this with many compiler developers, our experience is that most feel their work would benefit from a deeper understanding of attacks and hardening techniques. After having looked around, we didn't find much educational material that gives a broad overview, covering all aspects compiler developers ought to know about.
      Therefore, we recently started an open source book titled "Low Level Software Security for Compiler developers" at https://github.com/llsoftsec/llsoftsecbook/. It aims to improve the industry-wide knowledge about security hardening in compilers and related tools; ultimately leading to more innovation and better implementations of security features.
      In this presentation, we'll explain the rationale for this new open source project in more detail. We will discuss what content we have so far and what content we plan to add. The project very much welcomes new contributors: we need more new content, more review of content, discussion of ideas for how to make the book better, improvement in the design and layout of the produced HTML and PDF output, etc. We hope this presentation will reach both anyone interested in learning more about low-level software security and anyone interested in helping to grow this project further.</p>

      <p>Compilers play a crucial role in hardening software against security attacks. As compiler engineers we experience an increase in demand for security-related features: we simply work on security-related features more often.
      We find it tough to analyze whether the hardenings we implement are easy or hard to circumvent by attackers. After chatting about this with many compiler developers, our experience is that most feel their work would benefit from a deeper understanding of attacks and hardening techniques. After having looked around, we didn't find much educational material that gives a broad overview, covering all aspects compiler developers ought to know about.
      Therefore, we recently started an open source book titled "Low Level Software Security for Compiler developers" at https://github.com/llsoftsec/llsoftsecbook/. It aims to improve the industry-wide knowledge about security hardening in compilers and related tools; ultimately leading to more innovation and better implementations of security features.
      In this presentation, we'll explain the rationale for this new open source project in more detail. We will discuss what content we have so far and what content we plan to add. The project very much welcomes new contributors: we need more new content, more review of content, discussion of ideas for how to make the book better, improvement in the design and layout of the produced HTML and PDF output, etc. We hope this presentation will reach both anyone interested in learning more about low-level software security and anyone interested in helping to grow this project further.</p>

      <p>Digital and technical literacies are an ubiquitous requirement in modern research teams. Despite being fundamental, they are rarely part of the curriculum in universities, thus undergrad and early career researchers often struggle to code data analysis pipelines and to automate data collection from experimental setups. Neurosciences, in particular, relies a lot on these skills, with behavioural experiments planning, design of the testing boxes, data visualisation and analysis. To Successfully complete these tasks, researchers need to acquire a significant level of skill in programming and hardware design.
      To address these problems, we are developing a flexible open hardware platform to lower the barrier in creating experimental setups: BeeHive. It consists of a main board, which nests an ESP32 microcontroller, and several dedicated ‚Äúdaughter boards‚Äù, each designed to perform one function (e.g. one board senses temperature, another controls motors, etc). These boards are connected to one another using a standard system already used by other Open Hardware systems, so that there is no need to reinvent the wheel. We can then focus on developing things that are not available yet. The system runs MicroPython, which is a Python derivative for microcontrollers.
      This architecture allows users to be in control of everything that the platform is doing while also providing plenty of room for completely new applications. Modular structure helps users to get familiar with electronic components already at entry-level expertise while Python is employed for its strong points such as simplicity and widespread usage. In this presentation we set out to explore the core concept of Beehive, describe existing and possible applications.</p>

      <p>Performing simple DDL operations as ADD/DROP INDEX in a tightly connected cluster as PXC, can become a nightmare.
      Metalock will prevent Data modifications for long period of time and to bypass this, we need to become creative, like using Rolling schema upgrade or Percona online-schema-change.
      With NBO, we will be able to avoid such craziness at least for a simple operation like adding an index.
      In this brief talk I will illustrate what you should do to see the negative effect of NON using NBO, as well what you should do to use it correctly and what to expect out of it.</p>

      <p>We are all moving towards service-based operations and self-sufficient teams. We are all trying to enable developers to be more autonomous. However, it is unrealistic to expect everyone to become an expert on everything, from infrastructure to Kubernetes and everything in between. So, we cannot shift left due to lack of expertise, but we also cannot continue being reactive to the needs of others. The only option left is to simplify services or even remove direct access to infrastructure and Kubernetes.</p>

      <p>We might be able to accomplish those goals through Argo CD or Flux (GitOps), Crossplane (universal control plane), and KubeVela (OAM). By combining those, we can enable developers to manage everything yet still be in complete control of the aspects they care about. GitOps allows us to establish Git as the only point of interaction with the system. Crossplane Composites enable us to simplify developer experience when managing infrastructure. Finally, the Open Application Model (OAM) with KubeVela allows us to define applications instead of Kubernetes resources. If we combine those three types of tools and processes, we can enable operations to define the services used by developers to manage infrastructure and applications. We can do all that without anyone even knowing that there is Kubernetes behind all that.</p>

      <p>REST, the architecture underlying the web's protocols, has proven its benefits in creating a globe-spanning, decentralized information network. However, REST is showing its age - it was designed when surveillance capitalism, identity theft, information warfare, and other threats were largely hypothetical concerns. Unavoidably, REST leaves many of these issues unaddressed. Best practices fill some gaps, but may not be universally adopted.</p>

      <p>The Interpeer Project has been awarded a grant from the Internet Society Foundation for research and development into a next generation architecture that addresses current and future Internet user needs. Such an architecture needs to embrace the strengths of REST, incorporate known best practices, but ideally make worst practices impossible.</p>

      <p>This talk presents the issues with REST in some detail and lays out proposed solution sketches. The ideal is to invite participation, however. The 'net needs a wide range of view points to be fixed.</p>

      <p>In 2000, Roy Fielding published his dissertation on Representational State Transfer. Fielding had been actively working on the HTTP standards, which were guiding by informal design principles that REST formalizes. The talk will revisit this architectural style to disambiguate it from how the REST term has become applied since.</p>

      <p>Much as software freedoms exist, we need to address "internet user freedoms", and their relationship to human rights. Existing internet technology must be evaluated in this light, in how it supports or hinders human rights.</p>

      <p>In this presentation, architectural properties and constraints in the REST architectural style will be analyzed, with regards to the previous discussion as well as technical requirements. We will explore additional properties, and their effect on the architectural style.</p>

      <p>The talk will also provide background on concrete work already done or underway on this and adjacent topics.</p>

      <p>Detecting known software vulnerabilities is hard to do perfectly. However, the CVE Binary Tool is a tool which has been designed to analyse and trace dependencies by performing a binary analysis that attempts to detect the versions of the libraries in compiled applications in order to determine the vulnerabilities that may be present. Since the tool was initially released, the number of libraries which can be detected has steadily increased so now over 100 libraries can be detected primarily through the effort of students working under the Google Summer of Code (GSOC) programme. Supported libraries have typically been prioritised based on the number and frequency of vulnerabilities reported in the CVE database. The latest version of tool released at the end of 2021 has added capabilities to perform vulnerability scanning of Linux distros, Python applications and to consume Software Bill of Materials (both the SPDX and CycloneDX formats are supported). Further enhancements are planned in 2022.</p>

      <p>This presentation will describe how the tool works, how to use it in a number of use cases and show how you can contribute to further develop the capabilities of the tool.</p>

      <p>In the last decade, the field of AI has seen a great surge in capabilities in the field of machine learning techniques. Nowadays, models with up to billions of parameters are trained for wide arrays of downstream tasks and obtain performance that defy what a lot considered possible 20 years ago. However, reliance of machine learning models on the spurious correlations often prevents them from learning the intrinsic and invariant features of data which leads to their failure in generalizing to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data. Understanding and overcoming these failures has led to a research program on Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalization.</p>

      <p>The field has been extensively explored in the static computer vision tasks (Domainbed, WILDS), but has not been explored for sequential prediction tasks that are important modalities for multiple areas of applied machine learning, e.g. medical, finance, communication. We propose a set of new open source out-of-distribution generalization datasets for sequential prediction tasks spanning multiple modalities that acts as benchmarks for potential algorithms that promotes invariant learning. Along with the datasets, we provide a fair and systematic open source platform for evaluating performance of existing and potential algorithms on these datasets. We also provide a leaderboard which currently consists of the performance of popular algorithms in the field of OOD generalization.</p>

    subtitle: Making CryptPad more interoperable with common office formats

    abstract: |-
      <p>The import and export of common office formats (.ods/.xlsx, .odt/.docx, .odp/.ppt) is taken for granted in many online office suites. However, in the case of CryptPad, implementing such functionality presents a number of challenges to preserve our privacy requirements. This has long held back adoption of our platform as it prevented users from migrating existing documents and/or integrating CryptPad in their workflows.</p>

      <p>In this talk I will summarize our work on INTEROFFICE, a project realized by the CryptPad team in 2021 with funding from the EU's Next Generation Internet (NGI) DAPSI program.

      <p>The import and export of common office formats (.ods/.xlsx, .odt/.docx, .odp/.ppt) is taken for granted in many online office suites. However, in the case of CryptPad, implementing such functionality presents a number of challenges to preserve our privacy requirements. This has long held back adoption of our platform as it prevented users from migrating existing documents and/or integrating CryptPad in their workflows.</p>

      <p>In this talk I will summarize our work on INTEROFFICE, a project realized by the CryptPad team in 2021 with funding from the EU's Next Generation Internet (NGI) DAPSI program. The core of this work consists of a new set of converters that use Web Assembly to perform conversions between file formats in the browser. This allows for CryptPad to be vastly more inter-operable while preserving end-to-end encryption (the server still has no access to the content being converted).</p>

      <p>The reMarkable 2 is an eInk tablet, based on the i.MX7 SoC. The tablet
      ships with a fork of the 4.14 kernel and a custom rootFS built with

      large collection of rM2 specific patches on top.</p>

      <p>This talk discusses the process of adding support for the rM2 to the mainline

      <p>Metaprogramming in Nim is very powerful. But why would you use it? How is it used in the real world? We will explore the "power levels": starting from generics, continuing to templates and finally arriving at macros.</p>

      <p>We will first look at generics usage in VMath (Vector Math Library) and Jsony (JSON Parsing Library). Then we will continue on to templates and how they are used in VMath and Windy. Finally we will look macros, the top of the "power levels", and how they are used in Shady (a Nim to GLSL compiler) and Genny (Generates bindings for Nim libraries).</p>

      <p>Veracruz is a framework for designing and deploying privacy-preserving computations amongst a group of mutually mistrusting individuals. Veracruz uses strong isolation technologies, such as AWS Nitro Enclaves, Arm CCA Realms, and the high-assurance seL4 hypervisor, to provide a safe, neutral ground, within which a sandboxed WebAssembly program executes.
      Recent enhancements to Veracruz have made it possible to support larger, more complex privacy-preserving computations: we have adopted the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) as our programming model, which can be used by executing WebAssembly programs to query and modify an efficient in-memory filesystem, for example.
      In this talk, I will first introduce Veracruz before finally focusing on a real-world use-case for Veracruz, in privacy-preserving video object detection, developed as part of a collaboration between the Veracruz team and IOTEX, a manufacturer of IoT cameras.</p>

      <p>kalasim is a discrete event simulator written in pure Kotlin that enables complex, performant, dynamic process models. It provides a statically typed API, dependency injection, modern persistence, structured logging and automation capabilities.</p>

      <p>kalasim is designed for simulation practitioners, process analysts and industrial engineers, who need to go beyond the limitations of existing simulation tools to model and optimize their business-critical use-cases. In contrast to many other simulation tools, kalasim is neither low-code nor no-code. It is code-first to enable change tracking, scaling, refactoring, CI/CD, unit-tests, and the rest of the gang that makes simulation development fun.</p>

      <p>In the talk, we will learn about its core concepts and study several examples from different application domains.</p>

      <p>This talk is about a Matrix client called <a href="https://cinny.in/">Cinny</a>. It is built using reactjs on the top of matrix-js-sdk.</p>

      <p>The main focus behind making Cinny is to have a client that is simple, elegant and doesn't feel heavy on end user. Cinny was launched publicly in end of July 2021 and since then it has matured a lot. Cinny has support for end-to-end encryption with options to import and export encryption keys. It also has basic support for Spaces (coolest feature of Matrix). Cinny also has ton of other features most notably full UIAA (User-Interactive Authentication API including SSO Login), carefully crafted themes, Rich replies, Reactions, Markdown and the list goes on.</p>

      <p>Our roadmap also includes some other great features in near future; such as room settings, full support for spaces and later a responsive interface that also support mobile screens. We are also working on standalone app of Cinny using Tauri (exciting thing here is that app size is considerably less and doesn't require to have chromium to work).</p>

      <p>As the most popular open source relational database in the world, PostgreSQL keeps attracting the significant attention it deserves. With the ever increasing data storage and query requirements, new challenges are brought forward for horizontal elastic expansion and security of the PostgreSQL database.
      How to provide existing PostgreSQL databases with incremental capabilities such as data sharding, data encryption and other functions is of great concern to many PostgreSQL users.
      This session will focus on introducing how to empower PostgreSQL thanks to the ecosystem provided by Apache ShardingSphere - an open source distributed database, plus an ecosystem users and developers need for their database to provide a customized and cloud-native experience. ShardingSphere doesn't quite fit into the usual industry mold of a simple distributed database middleware solution. ShardingSphere recreates the distributed pluggable system, enabling actual user implementation scenarios to thrive and contributing valuable solutions to the community and the database industry.
      The aim of ShardingSphere is the Database Plus¬†concept.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Database Plus sets out to build a standard layer and an ecosystem layer above the fragmented database's basic services. A unified and standardized database usage specification provides for upper-level applications, and the challenges faced by businesses due to underlying databases fragmentation get minimized as much as possible. To link databases and applications, it uses traffic and data rendering and parsing. It provides users with enhanced core features, such as a distributed database, data security, database gateway, and stress testing.
      ShardingSphere uses a pluggable kernel architecture for Database Plus. That means there's modularity, which provides flexibility for the user.  Demos and notable use cases in production environments that are from the Asia equivalents of FAANG (Facebook, Amazon etc.) will be used to introduce the use and implementation of these functions for PostgreSQL databases.</p>

      I have prototyped for the Hedron microhypervisor. This prototype has also been
      used to quantify the runtime overhead of the proposed mitigation.</p>"
    description: |-
      <p>Processor-level vulnerabilities, such as Meltdown and Spectre v1/v2, allow attackers in userspace to leak information from the kernel address space. This is particularly devastating for kernel designs where the kernel address space is identical for all processes and thus allows the attacker to break the system's confidentiality boundaries.</p>

      <p>Previous mitigation attempts, such as kernel page-table isolation (formerly KAISER) for Meltdown and various branch predictor/speculation barriers for Spectre v1/v2, introduce costly instructions into performance critical parts of the operating system kernel. Especially mitigations related to the branch predictor are only possible if the CPU vendor has exposed special functionality.</p>

      <p>During the last six months I investigated an alternative mitigation strategy on the kernel design level that shows good mitigation properties, but adds negligible runtime overhead. This alternative mitigation involves moving process-related information in the kernel into a process-local part of the kernel address space. A userspace attacker that can infer the content of its associated kernel page table can thus only read information about its own process. Switching between these kernel address spaces is done as part of the normal address space switch when a thread in a different process is scheduled and thus comes with no additional cost.</p>

      <p>ARLAS Exploration is geo-analytic solution based on big-data technologies. It helps users who have big volumes of spatio-temporal data, to explore it through analytics and geo-analytics views.</p>

      <p>In this devroom we will use ARLAS to explore OSM data with an Analytic perspective. We will go through the following steps:
      - Download and index OSM data in a search engine (Elasticsearch) and make it available to exploration by ARLAS stack
      - Configure ARLAS dashboards based on this data and create analytical and geo-analytical views</p>

      <p>We will be able to answer questions such as:
      - How many buildings are in the downloaded dataset? And how are they distributed geographically ?
      - What are the different existing types of buildings? With what proportions ?
      - When this data has been created/edited and with what frequency ?</p>

      <p>Developed from 1995 onward, Prospero is a framework for longitudinal analysis of text corpora. Based on dictionaries and semi-automatic classification, it mainly allows its user to combine approaches of statistical computation, co-occurrence network and search for nested patterns. Inspired by pragmatic sociology, it focuses on the multiple forms of expression and argumentation used by actors, on language regimes and on the identification of transformations occurring in the research case. Initially distributed commercially, then from 2011, by the Doxa association,  as shareware under a non-profit and ethical charter, it is now hosted by the Corpora association and developed under the aGPLV3 CECILL variant Affero compliant license.</p>

      <p>In this presentation, we will discuss more specifically the question of the permanence of a research-targeted software approach, through its evolution over almost 30 years. During this period, evolving expectations and technical developments have led to a client/server step (which remained in the prototype stage) and now to the transition to SaaS. Based on this experience, we will also discuss the conditions we consider relevant for the durability of the software in a new interconnected phase. The broadening of its audience of users and developers calls for ever greater interoperability, on the technical level, but with an approach that combines non-profit and academic models (with limited resources) and business uses.</p>

      <p>Optimizing CPU management improves cluster performance and security, but is daunting to almost everyone.  CPU management may seem complex, but it can be explained in such a way that even your inner toddler will comprehend.  With this talk, we will give a path to success.</p>

      <p>You may have a multi-socket node cluster where your AI/ML workloads care about the proximity of your CPUs to GPUs.  You may be running scientific workloads where you want to pin in cores within containers instead of just a pod level.  You may have a single-socket server where you want to save a single core outside of Kubernetes for a daemon dedicated to mining bitcoin, without affecting your other jobs (please do not do this).  We will cover these and more, helping you understand the intricacies of CPU management within the kubelet and what Kuberenetes can and cannot currently do.  We will also cover how you can help escalate the visibility of use cases not currently covered within Kubernetes.</p>

      <p>It's a flexible library which can be used both to extend existing projects or to create new ones. It is notably used in the 18 years old IRC client WeeChat to teach it to speak Matrix. It has also been used as base for the re-write of GNOME's Matrix client Fractal.</p>

      <p>Thanks to its very modular nature, clients can either use the whole SDK, like WeeChat and Fractal do, or a sub-component. Element R uses matrix-rust-sdk's crypto crate via Kotlin bindings.</p>

      <p>Fractal is a popular Matrix chat client for the GNOME desktop which has been in development since 2017. Fractal was designed to work well for collaboration in large groups, such as free software projects.
      For a long time there were two main areas that needed improvements: performance and maintainability were limited. What‚Äôs more, it lacked end-to-end encryption (E2EE) support.</p>

      <p>Over the course of 2021 we spent countless hours rewriting Fractal from scratch and now we are close to the first release. Fractal-next is built on top of the matrix-rust-sdk, a set of libraries that help to build Matrix clients. The client, still written in Rust, now uses GTK4. During development, the focus was on performance, maintainability and E2EE. And of course, we kept mobile support.</p>

      <p>The writing of web publications mixing data visualization and textual prose opens novel opportunities for connecting evidence, arguments and narrative in social sciences communities. Such a practice poses a variety of challenges in terms of website design and development ; but also and maybe more importantly, it asks for experimenting specific workflows for coordinating a variety of expertises ranging from social sciences disciplines (history, sociology, etc.) to data science, information design and web-related skills. It also reconfigures, for the research processes themselves, the relationships between activities of (data-related) enquiry and (communication-oriented) writing, creating a renewed space for discovery, invention and verification for the data sustaining a given argument or narrative.</p>

      <p>Relying on recent experiments in making collective digital publications grounded in sociology of technology (https://medialab.github.io/carnet-algopresse/#/publication/en) and history of economy (https://medialab.github.io/portic-storymaps-2021/), this talk accounts for the diverse challenges arising from such activities of ‚Äúdata visualization-driven writing‚Äù, and some strategies we used to cope with them. It describes and compares the technical and methodological workflows we developed in order to simultaneously develop text, datasets and visualizations, taking into account a variety of aims, data materials, and distribution of skills. Doing so, it advocates for an extended understanding of the notion of ‚Äúacademic writing‚Äù, encompassing the practices of writing software, data and diagrams. Such an extended understanding, we argue, is necessary to design and develop writing workflows allowing to foster a multimodal and scientifically productive dialogue between these heterogeneous practices, taking full advantage of the web publication format as a research situation.</p>

      There is already a nice project "photOS" which is a lightweight linux for a DIY photoframe.
      Thanks to opensource software I was able to extend it in order to transfer the files not via WebDAV but with matrix having end-to-end encryption as well.</p>

    abstract: "<p>In chronobiology and sleep science, researchers often collect data
      using research-grade activity trackers called actigraphs, which measure movement
      and determine rest-activity cycles, and light dosimeters, which measure light
      exposure. At present, there is no meta-data standard for actigraphy and light
      exposure data that describe aspects of the data collection, such as device manufacturer,
      sampling rate, or instructions given to the participant. However, meta-data
      like those are critical for aggregating data and comparing data collected in
      different samples or across various research sites. Over the past 1+ year, we
      have been working on developing a consensus meta-data standard for describing
      actigraphy and light exposure data. The standard is written in JSON-schema,
      and is extendable to other time-series modalities (such as temperature). The
      standard is the joint effort of two teams of researchers volunteering their
      time. In this talk, I will describe the journey from inception to standard,
      along with the challenges and barriers encountered.</p>"

      <p>DPDK added a RCU library with a novel method to reclaim resources. We have been running tests to understand the performance differences between the DPDK RCU and the user space RCU library (https://liburcu.org/). In our tests, we find that DPDK RCU can perform reclamation faster and perform significantly better when pre-emptive readers are involved. Other than the performance, DPDK RCU has several advantages such as not requiring a background thread for reclaiming resources and the ability to integrate with existing libraries without having to modify the application.</p>

      <p>This talk will present various testing done on DPDK RCU and the user space RCU libraries and their results. It will go into the details of pre-emptive reader problem, which affects use cases beyond DPDK, and show that DPDK RCU library can reduce the reclamation time significantly.</p>

      <p>Under the hood, the apps use Collabs, a TypeScript library I'm developing. Collabs provides collaborative data structures - specifically CRDTs. These are classes that have APIs like ordinary data structures (Map, Array, etc.) but also automatically sync between clients, guaranteeing eventual consistency.

      <p>I am a social scientist who mostly teaches and conducts qualitative research, but I am also a programmer. Over the years, I have contributed to a variety of free and open source software projects, and since 2019, I have developed and maintained <code>textnets</code>, a Python package for text analysis that represents collections of texts as networks of documents and words, providing novel possibilities for the visualization and analysis of texts. In my field, such software development efforts are not usually rewarded, but I have been very fortunate. My academic superiors have been supportive of my endeavors, and a publication in the <em>Journal of Open Source Software</em> also helped me get official recognition for this work in the standard currency of my field.</p>

      <p>While I developed <code>textnets</code> to scratch my own itch, I seek to make the package widely available by providing extensive documentation and making it easily installable across multiple platforms. This part of my software development work -- learning the intricacies of version control, package managers, continuous integration testing, and dependency management -- puts me in a position to learn not just about the technical side of coding, but about the social side of the choices developers make. At least in the Python world, the way you learn about what dependencies to use, if any, and how many, is informed by norms more than by technical considerations, and the same is true for much else. By engaging in software development work, I engage in a version of the research method of participant observation -- learning by taking part -- that sociologists have called observant participation -- becoming part of what you want to learn about. In my case, I want to learn not just about software development and its culture and norms, but the wider world of free software, hacker culture, artistic practice based on FOSS tools, and more.</p>

      <p>In my talk, I provide some background to the development of <code>textnets</code>, give a brief demonstration of the package's features, and finally reflect on my experiences engaging in observant participation as well as some of the insights I have gained and still hope to gain.</p>

      <p>With over half a million developers worldwide, NVIDIA¬Æ JetsonTM is one of the most popular embedded computing platforms that brings AI performance to the Edge in a power-efficient and compact form factor</p>

      <p>In this talk, we will cover in detail a unique way of integrating a robust and secure over-the-air software (OTA) updates with the NVIDIA JetPack 4.6 production release that works for all Jetson System-on-Modules (SoMs) with support for the official L4T (Ubuntu-based) operating system, running JetPack 4.6 or later. As it is built on top of the latest JetPack SDK release, there is no need to have separate integrations when building and deploying applications on different Jetson SoMs. This has the benefit of enormously cutting down the bringup time of an OTA solution to do all types of OTA updates. It has low maintenance costs since it does not involve modifying the boot process and rather relying on officially supported tools by NVIDIA which should not ‚Äúbreak‚Äù with new L4T releases or board changes. We will cover the details of the integration with the high-level user flow as outline below, which ‚Äúclones‚Äù the running image of a golden device and deploys it in a robust manner to the entire fleet of devices:</p>

      <p>-Download L4T image from NVIDIA
      -Use NVIDIA tools to flash A/B setup with L4T image
      -Install Mender as deb package, plus integration layer
      -Run Mender snapshot to create Artifact
      -Deploy Artifact snapshot to fleet</p>

      SBOMs in SPDX format. In this presentation, I will introduce and demonstrate
      the features of SW360.</p>"
    description: |-
      <p>OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 is the International Standard for open source license compliance. In the OpenChain specification, there are descriptions of SBoM management and OSS license obligations, and SW360 has features to help with both of these.</p>

      <p>SPDX is an open standard for communicating software bill of material information, including components, licenses, copyrights, and security references.„ÄÄThis is also ISO standard (ISO/IEC 5962:2021).  A new feature in SW360 is the ability to register, import, and export software component information according to the SPDX format, making it easier to integrate with other tools and manage information received from other companies.</p>

      <p>For managing OSS licenses in SW360, the information about license obligations can be imported from the OSADL (Open Source Automation Development Lab) web site. This OSDAL's web site provides a machine-readble summary of the main points of the OSS license in a form that anyone can get. (Licensed by CC-BY-4.0).

    raw_abstract: "<p>The management of SBoM„ÄÄ(software bill of material) is very important
      for companies to comply with the OpenChain specification.The latest features
      of SW360 support the management of license obligations and the management of
      SBOMs in SPDX format. In this presentation, I will introduce and demonstrate
      the features of SW360.</p>"
    raw_description: |-
      <p>OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 is the International Standard for open source license compliance. In the OpenChain specification, there are descriptions of SBoM management and OSS license obligations, and SW360 has features to help with both of these.</p>

      <p>SPDX is an open standard for communicating software bill of material information, including components, licenses, copyrights, and security references.„ÄÄThis is also ISO standard (ISO/IEC 5962:2021).  A new feature in SW360 is the ability to register, import, and export software component information according to the SPDX format, making it easier to integrate with other tools and manage information received from other companies.</p>

      <p>For managing OSS licenses in SW360, the information about license obligations can be imported from the OSADL (Open Source Automation Development Lab) web site. This OSDAL's web site provides a machine-readble summary of the main points of the OSS license in a form that anyone can get. (Licensed by CC-BY-4.0). New features in SW360 allows you to quickly import this OSDAL license obigation information into your company's SW360.</p>

      <p>The persistent circular buffer (the <code>ib_logfile0</code>) is the fundament of the persistent InnoDB buffer pool.</p>

      <p>Over the years, the log file format has been changed in MariaDB Server to improve the performance. A well-designed file format imposes minimal write amplification and is easy to parse.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The 512-byte block size of the InnoDB log was a perfect match for the industry standard that was defined by the venerable Seagate ST-225. Alas, the industry moved on, and now block sizes range from 64 bytes (the size of a memory cache line) to 4096 bytes. Therefore, a format that works efficiently with any block size is needed.</p>

      <p>We present a flexible format where each mini-transaction (comprising log records) is a block on its own, with a checksum that is calculated in a local buffer, reducing contention on the mutex that protects the global log buffer. The old 12-byte block header is shrunk to a 1-bit sequence number, for detecting the end of the circular log. The additional overhead is 4 bytes per mini-transaction for a CRC-32C checksum.</p>

      <p>No-op records may be written to pad the log buffer to match the physical block size. Encryption will only cover data. The length of each record is explicitly stored in clear, which allows consistent hot backups without having any encryption keys. For encrypted log, 8-byte part of initialization vector will be written after each mini-transaction.</p>

      devices. The multi-OS specificity of Oniro will be used how the trusted
      computing technologies compare on different types of processors running
      Linux and Zephyr, with different security hardware support.</p>

      <p>A Linux distribution is a great playing field for testing tools for
      vulnerability scanning. It is even a better playing field if it includes
      more operating system kernels, like the Eclipse Oniro project does.
      Eclipse Oniro targets the Internet of Things (IOT) domain, where fixing
      security issues is critical.</p>

      <p>In this talk, Marta is going to present a return on experience of
      scanning for known vulerabilities (CVEs) in the Eclipse Oniro project.
      The presentation is going to start with an overview of tools based on
      Yocto's cve-check and additions from the Oniro project. Then it will
      cover examples of fixes, situations when we found errors in databases
      and tools, and how we fixed them. Finally, Marta
      is going to describe ideas of improvements in existing tools and propose
      new tools that can help the community.</p>

      <p>oVirt is an open source virtualization solution based on kvm, QEMU and libvirt.  Trusted Platform Module (TPM) device support, which brings new security capabilities that modern operating systems utilize or even require, was added to oVirt recently.</p>

      <p>In theory, adding TPM support should be as easy as just adding a TPM device to the virtual machine libvirt XML.  But features built on top of a lower-level virtualization platform are not always as easy to implement as they may initially seem to be.  This talk will present the challenges experienced when adding TPM support to oVirt.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The talk will explain that a supposedly complete feature support in libvirt/QEMU may still require challenging design considerations. What can be used easily in a simple virtual machine running on a desktop computer may not be enough to get the things working well and reliably in a virtual machine management running across many hosts.</p>

      <p>Some of the challenges experienced with TPM support have been sorted out while other ones still wait for a good solution.  Although focusing on TPM, the lessons presented in this talk can apply to a wide range of features.  Whatever we work on, we cannot be just passive consumers of features but we must look for the right ways of using them and be proactive in avoiding pitfalls.</p>

      <p>I'm working on a Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) browser game which uses Matrix for authentication, authorization and storing save states.
      Lobbies and characters are managed as Matrix rooms which allows players to have a copy of their character's data at all times, migrate it to other Matrix accounts or share a character with friends.</p>

      <p>What if games allowed you to really own your online characters?
      If an online video game shuts down, your character is gone.
      All progress, all contacts, all items ‚Äì lost to you and not available for migration.</p>

      <p>I'm building a tiny proof of concept browser game where you log in with your Matrix account.
      All your characters are represented by Matrix rooms and you can migrate them to other Matrix accounts and other gaming servers.</p>

      <p>Instead of sending all communication via Matrix this concept uses a public server software and central gaming servers (HTTP and websockets in this case).
      Upon character creation, a game server invites you to your character's room. Every time your character changes the server updates a state event.
      If the server gets shutdown, it's easy to set up a new server which allows to migrate character rooms from the old server.
      Furthermore, players can analyze their characters without the need to contact the gaming server.</p>

      <p>Yes, BTF and CO-RE are improving the situation.
      But, writing eBPF is still mostly about fighting against the BPF VM verifier.</p>

      <p>That's why I sat down and wrote bpfcov.

      <p>During this talk, I will show the audience the secrets of the BPF target in LLVM and how I wrote an out-of-tree LLVM pass to instrument eBPF programs with counters, counters expressions, and friends.</p>

      This marked a major evolution in the communication of the project, and opened
      the door to more ways for us to connect with each other. It also followed a
      substantial amount of planning from the community team, in terms of architecture

      &amp; proposal, how the rollout has gone, and where we think we're going next.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>There's much we <em>could</em> cover in this talk, but we'll definitely have content on the 2-homesever architecture we used (and why), on how adoption is going with our community (bridges will feature here,  at least) and community building &amp; promotion (expect armchair-sociology while I talk about rich interaction mediums, but also things like newsrooms, interaction fragmentation, etc). I'll also be attempting to gather some feedback from our community to present as well.</p>

      <p>Who is this talk for: We hope it'll be of interest to anyone thinking of recommending Matrix for their community - whether a FOSS community, or more generally, there's things to think about first and arguments that can be re-used. There will also be interest for existing Matrix users too, in terms of lessons learned and wishlist features for the future.</p>

      we had in mind. In this talk, we'll take a look back over our original architecture
      &amp; proposal, how the rollout has gone, and where we think we're going next.</p>
    raw_description: |-
      <p>There's much we <em>could</em> cover in this talk, but we'll definitely have content on the 2-homesever architecture we used (and why), on how adoption is going with our community (bridges will feature here,  at least) and community building &amp; promotion (expect armchair-sociology while I talk about rich interaction mediums, but also things like newsrooms, interaction fragmentation, etc). I'll also be attempting to gather some feedback from our community to present as well.</p>

      <p>Who is this talk for: We hope it'll be of interest to anyone thinking of recommending Matrix for their community - whether a FOSS community, or more generally, there's things to think about first and arguments that can be re-used. There will also be interest for existing Matrix users too, in terms of lessons learned and wishlist features for the future.</p>

      <p><a href="github.com/dcmoura/spyql">SPyQL</a> is SQL with Python in the middle, an open-source project fully written in Python for making command-line data processing more intuitive, readable and powerful. Try mixing in the same pot: a SQL SELECT for providing the structure, Python expressions for defining transformations and conditions, the essence of awk as a data-processing language, and the JSON handling capabilities of jq.</p>

      <p>In this event I will describe the SPyQL language, highlighting its unique features. By the end of this presentation you will know how to write SPyQL queries (probably you already know :-) ), and you will be looking forward to starting using it! I will be solving the task of calculating aggregations in awk (for a CSV), in jq (for a JSON) and in SPyQL (for both). I will then show you a couple more examples where we will be using SPyQL 1) to automate a scaling operation of k8s pods, and 2) to continuously calculate statistics from a Kafka data stream.</p>

      we are 1) reading a CSV (of purchases) with automatic header detection, dialect
      detection, type inference and casting, 2) filtering out records that do not
      belong to the IT department or do not have a purchase timestamp 3) summing the
      total purchases and grouping by how many days ago they happened, 4) sorting
      from the most to the least recent day and 5) writing the result in JSON format.
      All this without loading the dataset into memory.</p>\n\n<p>SPyQL will change
      data-processing in the terminal, making it accessible to anyone who knows a
      little-bit of Python and understands the basics of a SQL SELECT.\nOn the other
      hand, it will give super-powers to experienced users. The possibilities are
      endless as you can import any Python library, and pipe data from/to any command-line
      tool. From querying APIs and Kafka, to write to files or databases, SPyQL will
      be the tool of choice for processing data in the command-line!</p>"

      <p>We made the Web accessible to human.
      We are making the web accessible to computers with Linked Open Data (LOD - https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data).
      More and more RDF data is created by people and institutions to contribute to the LOD.
      However, publishing this RDF data with content negotiation is rarely done, because there is no on-shelve solution.
      Moreover, there is no easy to use user interface to manage linked data (including CRUD operations, but also user permissions, rendering, etc.).</p>

      <p>CubicWeb is a SCMS (Semantic Content Management System) for Linked Open Data (https://forge.extranet.logilab.fr/cubicweb/cubicweb).
      This python-based framework can be used to import OWL schema and RDF data automatically to generate a new CubicWeb instance.
      This instance can be used out-of-the-box as a single application to serve RDF data through a conventional web interface for browsing and through
      content negotiation for downloading. No need to configure anything, just import and launch the app.
      The CubicWeb framework implements an administration interface to manage data easily even
      for non-technical people. All the common features of a web application framework are available.</p>

      <p>KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing) is an API from Google for writing Kotlin compiler plugins. Using KSP we can write annotation processors to reduce boilerplate and solve cross-cutting concerns. Also KSP is more effective than KAPT. Among the advantages of using it is the support of Kotlin Multiplatform.
      Another way to optimize common code is to use Kotlin plugins.

    subtitle: A Fedora Remix built to leverage KVM/QEMU virtualization locally

      <p>Most Linux distributions are not designed to support desktop virtualization, and GPU vendors have failed to agree on a common way to let virtual machines access 3D capabilities (SR-IOV; vfio-pci; vfio-mdev or virtio-gpu...). The result is that it is still complicated to create fast and responsive virtual machines locally.</p>

      <p>Phyllome OS is a Fedora Remix based on Fedora Server which attempts to make it easier to run virtual machines locally on computers that support hardware-assisted virtualization, using mostly paravirtualization (aka virtio-devices). It currently relies on existing technologies (libvirt; KVM/QEMU; virt-manager; GNOME Shell; etc), but will eventually implement its own virtual machine manager, package the cloud hypervisor as an alternative to QEMU, and use filesystem-level  encryption to protect virtual machines disks. The main idea behind this OS is to treat the host, Phyllome OS, as a read-only system, i.e. as a mere appliance to host virtual machines. The presentation will give a demonstration of Phyllome OS in its current state.</p>

      <p>Despite steady progress, especially on the KVM/QEMU front, desktop virtualization today still leaves much to be desired when it comes to usability. For most users, it is still complicated to create virtual machines with advanced media capabilities, including 3D acceleration. 3D-accelerated guests are a must-have nowadays and most desktop environments leverage it to provide a smooth user experience. Existing approaches attempting to grant 3D capabilities to virtual machines are not straightforward,  sometimes incompatible and often require trade-offs between usability, performance and security. As a result, a successful implementation on a single host typically requires careful considerations and is often hardware-dependent. For instance, passing through real hardware to a virtual machine using vfio-pci is only possible if the piece of hardware is well-isolated in a single IOMMU group. Paravirtualization, on the other hand, and especially virtio-gpu, promises to be hardware-independent but is not (yet?) supported by all modern guest operating systems.</p>

      <p>What if an operating system was designed to provide the best experience regardless of the guest operating system in use?</p>

      <p>Finding brilliant and diverse engineers, who could maintain complex open-source projects, lead communities and be productive employees is an extremely hard task these days. It‚Äôs easy for aspiring talents to feel lost, be ashamed and give up in the process due to the transparent aspect of work in open source. We believe we found a quite neat shortcut to this!</p>

      <p>The solution is called ‚Äústructured mentoring‚Äù and in this talk, Prem and Bartek, maintainers of CNCF projects, will explain why this is a game-changer, based on their experience mentoring 20+ talents for the Thanos and Prometheus projects.</p>

      <p>There are many mentoring programs like LFX, GSoC or Outreachy but it is easy to make mistakes, get lost and have no results from mentoring if not done carefully.</p>

      <p>Join us to learn what processes worked the best to get the most out of the open-source mentorship. Learn what mistakes to avoid, how to get mentored and how to start mentoring in your company or open source project today</p>

      <p>Understanding what is happening with a distributed solution can be challenging.

Many of these tools work by bulk central analysis rather than enabling events of interest to be spotted as they‚Äôre logged.
      Fluentd presents us with a means to simplify the monitoring landscape, address challenges of hyper-distribution occurring with microservice solutions, allowing different tools needing log data to help in their different way. Without imposing a specific analysis tool on relevant teams.
      In this session, we‚Äôll explore the challenges of modern log management.  We‚Äôll look at how Fluentd works and what it can bring to making both development and ops activities easier.  To do this we‚Äôll explore and demo some examples of Fluentd and how it makes life easier &amp; more efficient.</p>

      <p>Scientific workflows are readily and most easily expressed as shell scripts. However, shell scripts are notorious for being "duct tape", and are hard to adapt to different hardware and software environments. Workflow languages such as the Common Workflow Language (CWL) were developed to address this pain point. However, CWL does come at the cost of increased verbosity and reduced readability. Even seasoned scientists shy away from writing CWL, and fall back to the familiarity of shell scripts.</p>

      <p>This need not be. There is no reason to inflict the behind-the-scenes complexity of workflow languages on the user. It should be possible to automatically translate (in other words, compile) a simple shell-like script into a workflow language specification. In effect, we create a new domain specific language that is almost as easy to write as a shell script, but compiles to CWL. No other language is better suited to this task of creating domain specific languages than lisp. The lisps with their homoiconicity and unique macro system empower the programmer to use ordinary code to hack the compiler itself.</p>

      <p>In this talk, I will present the Concise Common Workflow Language (ccwl). The Concise Common Workflow Language (ccwl) is a concise syntax to express CWL workflows. It is a compiler that compiles a simple lispy shell-like workflow specification into a CWL workflow. It is implemented in the Scheme programming language, a minimalist dialect of lisp. I will discuss the considerations that went into the design of ccwl, and demonstrate its expressive power with illustrative examples.</p>

It is a compiler that compiles a simple lispy shell-like workflow specification into a CWL workflow. It is implemented in the Scheme programming language, a minimalist dialect of lisp. I will discuss the considerations that went into the design of ccwl, and demonstrate its expressive power with illustrative examples.</p>

      <p>In FOSDEM 2019 we presented the addition of high-performance virtual machines in oVirt.
      With this new VM type, parts of the VM configuration were changed to improve the performance of workloads it runs.
      In particular, it was useful for CPU-intensive workloads, such as SAP HANA.
      However, better performance came at the expense of usability. Users were still expected to set various things manually, like CPU and NUMA pinning and hugepages.
      In this talk, I will guide you through our journey of simplifying and automating the settings of high performance VMs in oVirt.
      We'll see the evolution of the changes, the challenges we faced, where we are today and what's more to come in oVirt 4.5.</p>

      <p>Fuzion is a modern general purpose programming language that unifies concepts
      found in structured, functional and object-oriented programming languages into
      the concept of a Fuzion feature.  It combines a powerful syntax and safety
      features based on the design-by-contract principle with a simple intermediate
      representation that enables powerful optimizing compilers and static analysis
      tools to verify correctness aspects.</p>

      <p>This talk will present the advances in the Fuzion languages since its first
      public announcement at FOSDEM 2021.  This includes a simplified and cleaned-up
      syntax, improved type inference, its safety features, foreign language
      interface to Java and an overview of the existing and planned toolchain.</p>

      <p>Fuzion is not only about the language itself, but just as well about the
      intermediate representation that is the basis for static analysis, optimization
      and back-ends. The talk will give an overview of the format of intermediate code.</p>
    description: "<h1>Introduction</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion is a modern general purpose programming
      language that unifies concepts\nfound in structured, functional and object-oriented
      programming languages into\nthe concept of a Fuzion feature.  It combines a
      powerful syntax and safety\nfeatures based on the design-by-contract principle
      with a simple intermediate\nrepresentation that enables powerful optimizing
      compilers and static analysis\ntools to verify correctness aspects.</p>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      was influenced by many other languages including Java, Python, Eiffel,\nRust,
      Go, Lua, Kotlin, C#, F#, Nim, Julia, Clojure, C/C++, and many more.  The\ngoal
      of Fuzion is to define a language that has the expressive power present in\nthese
      languages and allow high-performance implementations and powerful analysis\ntools.
      \ Furthermore, Fuzion addresses requirements for safety-critical\napplications
      by adding support for contracts that enable formal specification and\nenable
      detailed control over run-time checks.</p>\n\n<p>Many current programming language
      are getting more and more overloaded with new\nconcepts and syntax to solve
      particular development or performance issues.\nLanguages like Java/C# provide
      classes, interfaces, methods, packages, anonymous\ninner classes, local variables,
      fields, closures, etc.  And these languages are\ncurrently further extended
      by the introductions of records/structs, value types,\netc.  The possibility
      of nesting these different concepts results in\ncomplexity for the developer
      and the tools (compilers, VMs) that process and\nexecute the code.</p>\n\n<p>For
      example, the possibility to access a local variable as part of the closure\nof
      a lambda expression may result in the compiler allocating heap space to hold\nthe
      contents of that local variable.  Hence, the developer has lost control over\nthe
      allocation decisions made by the compiler.</p>\n\n<p>In Fuzion, the concepts
      of classes, interfaces, methods, packages, fields and\nlocal variables are unified
      in the concept of a Fuzion feature. The decision\nwhere to allocate the memory
      associated with a feature (on the heap, the stack\nor in a register) is left
      to the compiler just as well as the decision if\ndynamic type information is
      needed.  The developer is left with the single\nconcept of a feature, the language
      implementation takes care of all the rest.</p>\n\n<h1>Fuzion Feature Declarations</h1>\n\n<p>A
      Fuzion feature has a name, similar to the name of a class or a function.\nThe
      main operation that can be performed on a feature is a feature call.  The\nconstituents
      of a feature declaration are as follows:</p>\n\n<h2>Formal Arguments</h2>\n\n<p>Features
      may have a list of formal arguments, which are themselves features\nimplemented
      as fields.  On a call to a feature with formal arguments, actual\narguments
      have to be provided to the call, unless the list of formal arguments\nis empty.</p>\n\n<h2>Feature
      Result</h2>\n\n<p>The result of a feature call is an instance of the feature.
      \ Alternatively, a\nfeature may declare a different result type, then it must
      return a value of that\ntype on a call.</p>\n\n<h2>Closures</h2>\n\n<p>Features
      are nested, i.e., every feature is declared within the context of an\nouter
      feature.  The only exception is the universe, which is the outermost\nfeature
      in Fuzion.  A feature can access features declared in its\nouter feature or,
      recursively, any outer feature of these outer features.  This\nmeans, a feature
      declaration also defines a closure of the feature and its\ncontext.</p>\n\n<p>When
      calling a feature <em>f1</em> declared as an inner feature of <em>f2</em>, the
      call must\ninclude a target value which is the result of a call to <em>f2</em>,
      e.g., <em>f2.f1</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Generics</h2>\n\n<p>Features may have generic
      type parameters. E.g. a feature declaration may leave\nthe actual type used
      within that feature open and to be defined by the user of\nthe feature.</p>\n\n<p>The
      list of generic type parameters may be open, i.e., the number of actual\ngeneric
      type parameters is not fixed at feature declaration.  This turns out to\nbe
      useful in the declaration of choice types and functions as explained below.</p>\n\n<h2>Inheritance</h2>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      features can inherit from one or several other features.  When inheriting\nfrom
      an existing features, all inner features of the parent automatically become\ninner
      features of the heir feature.  It is possible to redefine inherited\nfeatures.
      \ In particular, when inheriting from a feature with abstract inner\nfeatures,
      one can implement the inherited abstract features.</p>\n\n<p>A redefinition
      of an inherited feature may implement an inherited feature as a\nroutine or
      as a field.  An inherited feature that is implemented as a field,\nhowever,
      cannot be redefined as something else since fields might be mutable.</p>\n\n<p>Inheritance
      may result in conflicts. An example would be two features with the\nsame name
      that are inherited from two different parents.  In this case, the heir\nmust
      resolve the conflict either by redefining the inherited features and\nproviding
      a new implementation or by renaming the inherited features resulting\nin two
      inner features in the heir feature.</p>\n\n<p>Inheritance and redefinition in
      Fuzion does not require dynamic binding.  By\ndefault, the types defined by
      features are value types and no run-time overhead\nfor dynamic binding is imposed
      by inheritance.</p>\n\n<h2>A Contract</h2>\n\n<p>A feature may declare a contract
      that specifies what the features does and under\nwhich conditions the feature
      may be called.</p>\n\n<h2>An implementation</h2>\n\n<p>Features must have one
      of the following implementations</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>a routine is a feature
      implementation with code that is executed on a call</p></li>\n<li><p>a field
      is a memory slot that stores a value and whose contents are returned on a call</p></li>\n<li><p>an
      abstract feature has no implementation and cannot be called directly, but can
      be implemented by heir features</p></li>\n<li><p>an intrinsic feature is a low-level
      feature implemented by the compiler or\nrun-time system, e.g., the infix + operator
      to add two 32-bit integer values\nmay be an intrinsic operation.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>A
      feature implemented as a routine can contain inner feature declarations.</p>\n\n<h1>Feature
      examples</h1>\n\n<p>Here is an example that declares a feature <em>point</em>
      that functions similar to a\nstruct or record in other languages:</p>\n\n<pre><code>point(x,
      y i32) is # empty\np1 := point 3 4\nsay \"p1.x is {p1.x}\"    # will print \"p1.x
      is 3\"\nsay \"p1.y is {p1.y}\"    # will print \"p1.y is 4\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The
      next example shows a feature <em>base</em> that provides an inner feature <em>plus</em>\nthat
      adds its argument to the value passed to the enclosing base:</p>\n\n<pre><code>base(v
      i32) is\n  plus(w i32) =&gt; v + w\n\nb1 := base 30\nb2 := base 100\nsay (b1.plus
      23)    # will print \"53\"\nsay (b2.plus 23)    # will print \"123\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>Fuzion
      Syntax Evolution</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion provides two main syntax alternatives, a
      classic once using semicolons,\nbraces and parentheses and a modern one using
      white-space and indentation.  Both\nare equivalent, there should be tools between
      these two representations of\nsource code.  The following explains the main
      ideas how white-space is used\ninstead of special symbols</p>\n\n<h2>Separating
      Statements</h2>\n\n<h3>Flat line feeds instead of semicolons</h3>\n\n<p>The
      classic way to separate statements is by using a semicolon as in</p>\n\n<pre><code>stmt1;
      stmt2; stmt3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<pre><code>stmt1;\nstmt2;\nstmt3;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The
      Fuzion grammar knows a symbol called 'flat line feed', which is a line feed\nwith
      the next line starting with white space up to the previous line's\nindentation
      level. A 'flat line feed' is considered equivalent to a semicolon,\nso the sequence
      of three statements above can be written without semicolons as\nfollows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>stmt1\nstmt2\nstmt3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Indenting
      line feeds to form blocks</h3>\n\n<p>Code blocks in Fuzion can be build using
      braces similar to many other languages</p>\n\n<pre><code>if cond { stmnt1 }
      else { stmnt2 }\n\nif cond {\n  stmnt1\n} else {\n  stmnt2\n}\n\nif cond\n  {\n
      \   stmnt1\n  }\nelse\n  {\n    stmnt2\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>An 'indenting
      line feed' in Fuzion is a line feed with the next line starting at\na higher
      indentation level.  The parser treats an 'indenting line feed' like a\nleft
      brace '{'. Correspondingly, a linefeed that reduces the indentation level\nback
      to the original level is treated like a right brace '}'. The example above\nis
      hence equivalent to</p>\n\n<pre><code>if cond\n  stmnt1\nelse\n  stmnt2\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally,
      an optional keyword 'then' may as well be used to separate an\nexpression like
      the condition in an 'if' from a following expression without the\nneed of braces:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if
      cond then stmnt1 else stmnt2\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Separating calls, arguments
      and operator expressions</h2>\n\n<h3>calls without parentheses</h3>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      calls do not need parentheses or commas to separate the called feature\nand
      its arguments, i.e., a call</p>\n\n<pre><code>f(a, b, c)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>can
      be written as</p>\n\n<pre><code>f a b c\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Parameters are
      then separated by white space. Line breaks, either flat or\nindenting as explained
      above, end the argument list.</p>\n\n<p>Parentheses may be needed for nesting
      calls with arguments, e.g., the code</p>\n\n<pre><code>f (g x y) (h z)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is
      equivalent to</p>\n\n<pre><code>f(g(x, y), h(z))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If placed
      in parentheses, operator expressions may extend over several lines\nusing an
      indenting line feed followed by additional flat line feeds, e.g.,</p>\n\n<pre><code>f
      (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +\n   5 + 6 + 7 + 8 +\n   9 + 10 + 11 + 12)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Tuples
      of values such as '(a, b)' syntactically look like argument lists.  A list\nof
      expressions enclosed in parentheses is treated as an argument list only if it\nimmediately
      follows the name of a called feature. The code</p>\n\n<pre><code>f(a, b)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>hence
      calls 'f' with two arguments 'a' and 'b'. In case there is white space\nafter
      the name of the called feature as in</p>\n\n<pre><code>f (a, b)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>the
      expression in parentheses is passed as an argument, so, in this case 'f'\nwill
      be called with a single argument: the tuple '(a, b)'.</p>\n\n<h3>Array indexing
      vs. array creation</h3>\n\n<p>The square brackets '[' and ‚Äô]‚Äô are used in Fuzion
      for two purposes: A\npre-initialized array of fixed size can be created using
      an expression like\n'[x, y, z]', while an array can be indexed using 'a[i]'.
      \ Again, white space can\nbe used to distinguish these two cases:</p>\n\n<pre><code>a[i]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>read
      an element from an array while</p>\n\n<pre><code>f [x, y, z]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>create
      array with elements x, y and z and passes it as an argument in a call to\n'f'.</p>\n\n<h3>Operator
      expressions</h3>\n\n<p>Operators are parsed as prefix- or postfix operators
      if the are not separated by\nwhite space from their target operand, but they
      are separated by white space on\nthe other side.  This means that the call</p>\n\n<pre><code>f
      -x\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is equivalent to</p>\n\n<pre><code>f (-x)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>while</p>\n\n<pre><code>f
      - x\nf-x\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>both subtract 'x' from 'f'. Furthermore,</p>\n\n<pre><code>f-
      x\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is parsed as</p>\n\n<pre><code>(f-) x\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>i.e.,
      it calls 'postfix -' on 'f' and, assuming the result is a function, calls\nthis
      result with one argument 'x'.</p>\n\n<p>The precedence of operators that are
      not separated by white space is stronger\nthan that of a call, so</p>\n\n<pre><code>f
      a-b\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is equivalent to</p>\n\n<pre><code>f (a-b)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>while
      the precedence of calls is higher than that of operators separated by\nwhite
      space, i.e,</p>\n\n<pre><code>f a -b\nf a - b\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>are equivalent
      to</p>\n\n<pre><code>f (a) (-b)\n(f a) - b\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>respectively.</p>\n\n<h2>White
      space vs. explicit tokens</h2>\n\n<p>Attaching semantics to white space might
      appear dangerous and error-prone to\nthose not used to it.  However, more and
      more languages (Python, Scala-3, Nim,\nRaku, ...) make use of white-space and
      the experience is generally very positive,\nthe code is cleaner, easier to read
      an even easier to maintain.  Compiler errors\ncomplaining about unbalanced parentheses
      or braces are gone and mismatch between\nindentation and semantics may no longer
      occur.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, even languages like Java allow code to have hugely
      different\nsemantics if just a single white space is added, e.g., the Java code</p>\n\n<pre><code>if
      (cc) x(); elsey();\nif (cc) x(); else y();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>changes completely
      by insertion of a single space character.</p>\n\n<h1>Fuzion Type Inference</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      is statically typed, every expression, every field, every routine result\nhas
      a static type known at compile time.  Type inference is used to avoid the\nneed
      to specify these types explicitly in many situations, reducing the\nboilerplate
      code while keeping the safety of a statically types language.</p>\n\n<p>Type
      inference in Fuzion occurs at explicit or implicit assignments. An explicit\nassignment
      is a field declaration with an initial value such as</p>\n\n<pre><code>v :=
      expr\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>while an implicit assignment occurs, e.g., when a
      routine returns the value of\nits last expression as its result</p>\n\n<pre><code>sum
      (x, y u32) =&gt;\n  x + y\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or when an argument is passed
      to a function</p>\n\n<pre><code>sum 1.234e6 567890\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Type
      inference occurs in two directions: From the value to the field that the\nvalue
      is assigned to and from the type of the assigned field to the value.\nField
      declarations using ':=' without an explicit type use the type inferred\nfrom
      the value, the same holds for routines defined using '=>'.</p>\n\n<p>On the
      other hand, the type of expressions such as lambdas or numeric literals are\ninferred
      from what they are assigned to.</p>\n\n<h2>Type inference from expressions to
      feature result type</h2>\n\n<p>When declaring either a field using ':=' or a
      routine using '=>', the result\ntype is inferred from the expression that is
      assigned or returned, respectively:</p>\n\n<pre><code>v := 123                    #
      type i32, default type for integer literal\nv := \"hello\"                #
      type string\nhighNibble(b u8) =&gt; b &gt;&gt; 4  # type u8\norigin =&gt; point
      0 0         # type point\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Type inference from expressions
      to type arguments</h2>\n\n<p>Type arguments are inferred from actual arguments
      as shown by the following\nexample: Imagine a generic routine <em>square</em>
      as follows</p>\n\n<pre><code>square&lt;T: integer&lt;T&gt;&gt; (a T) =&gt; a
      * a\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This could be called using explicit type arguments
      as in</p>\n\n<pre><code>say (square&lt;i32&gt; 23)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or the
      type can be inferred from the argument type</p>\n\n<pre><code>say (square 23)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As
      a consequence, type arguments can be omitted in many cases.</p>\n\n<h2>Type
      inference for lambdas</h2>\n\n<p>In Fuzion, inline functions (lambdas) are defined
      using '->' with the input\nvariables on the left and the expression on the right.
      \ Types for a lambda are\nimplicitly taken from the target the lambda is assigned
      to. E.g., the following\nexample takes a function argument</p>\n\n<pre><code>print(s
      string, f (string, i32) -&gt; string) =&gt;\n  say (f s 3)\n\nprint(f (i32,
      i32) -&gt; i32) =&gt;\n  say (f 10 3)\n\nprint \"Alice\" (s,i -&gt; s * i)   #
      lambda type is (string, i32) -&gt; string\nprint \"Bob\"   (s,i -&gt; s + i)\nprint
      (s,i -&gt; s * i)           # lambda type is (i32, i32) -&gt; i32\nprint (s,i
      -&gt; s + i)\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Type inference for numeric constants</h2>\n\n<p>Numeric
      constants that are assigned to a given type inherit that type.  There is\nno
      immediate distinction between plain numeric literals like '123' or ones using\na
      fractional parts and exponents such as '-0.1234E4'. The target type determines\nthe
      type of the constant.</p>\n\n<pre><code>v1 u32 := 123456\nv2 i8 := -128\nv3
      i16 := 32000\nv4 u64 := 1000000000000000000\nv5 i64 := -1000000000000000000\nv6
      u16 := 4711\nv7 f32 := 123456\nv8 f64 := 123.456E6\nv9 f64 := 1.0E3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In
      case the constant is too large for the target\ntype, or it has a fractional
      part not representable by the type, a compile-time\nerror occurs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>v1
      u32 := -123456       # error: negative value assigned to unsigned\nv2 i32 :=
      3000000000    # error: value too large\nv3 i8  := 128           # error: value
      too large\nv4 u16 := 65536         # error: value too large\nv5 f32 := 123.456E39
      \   # error: overflow\nv7 f64 := 123.456E309   # error: overflow\nv8 f32 :=
      7E-46         # error: underflow\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>Fuzion Intermediate Files</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      uses intermediate files during different stages of compilation: module\nfiles
      that contain library code, application files for whole applications and\nFuzion
      intermediate representation files that serve as input to the back ends.</p>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      uses a simple intermediate code to represent pre-compiled modules and\nwhole
      applications. This intermediate code serves as the input for static\nanalysis
      tools, optimizers and for different back-ends that produce executable\napplications.
      \ The goal in the design of the intermediate file format was high\nperformance
      and simplicity for tools using this code.</p>\n\n<p>The intermediate code is
      a binary format containing features and types in a way\nthat may be mapped to
      memory and used directly, so overhead of parsing this\nformat into an in-memory
      representation is avoided.  In particular, if only parts\nof a pre-compiled
      module are used by an application, there is no need to read and\nunpack parts
      of the module intermediate representation that are not used.</p>\n\n<p>For features
      containing code, a very simple stack-based format is used. There\nare currently
      only ten different instructions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Unit -- produce a value of
      unit type</li>\n<li>Current -- produce the current instance as a value</li>\n<li>Constant
      -- produce a constant value</li>\n<li>Assign -- perform an assignment to a field</li>\n<li>Call
      -- perform a call to a given feature</li>\n<li>Tag -- convert a value into a
      tagged value of a choice type</li>\n<li>Match -- match a choice type</li>\n<li>Box
      -- convert a value type to a ref type</li>\n<li>Unbox -- extract the value from
      a ref type</li>\n<li>Pop -- drop the top element from the stack</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>The
      intermediate code uses indices to refer to features and types within\nintermediate
      files.  This means that lookup is very efficient, but it also means\nthat a
      change in a library module requires recompilation of all dependent\nmodules.
      \ Any incompatibilities would be found at compile time instead of\nresulting
      in something like Java's 'IncompatibleClassChangeError' at run-time.</p>\n\n<h1>Foreign
      language interface</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion provides a tool 'fzjava' that takes a Java
      module file and converts it\ninto Fuzion features.  In the spirit of Fuzion,
      Java's packages, classes,\ninterfaces, methods, constructors, static methods
      and fields are all converted\ninto Fuzion features.  Java methods that may throw
      an exception are\nconverted into features resulting in a choice type that is
      either the exception\ntype or the result type of that method.</p>\n\n<p>A few
      intrinsic functions in the Java interpreter back-end use Java's reflection\nAPI
      to access the corresponding Java code.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a example how Java
      code can be used from Fuzion:</p>\n\n<pre><code>javaString := java.lang.String.new
      \"Hello Java \U0001F30D!\"                          # create Java string, type
      Java.java.lang.String\njavaBytes  := javaString.getBytes \"UTF8\"                                     #
      get its UTF8 bytes, type is fuzion.java.Array&lt;i8&gt;\nmatch javaBytes\n  err
      error =&gt; say \"got an error: $err\"\n  bytes fuzion.java.Array =&gt;\n    say
      \"string has {bytes.count} bytes: $bytes\"\n    javaString2 := java.lang.String.new
      bytes 6 bytes.count-6                # create Java string from bytes subset,\n
      \   say \"Hello \"+javaString2                                                 #
      append Java string to Fuzion string and print it\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>C back-end</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      now has a back-end that produces C source code to be compiled to machine\ncode
      using clang and LLVM.</p>\n\n<h1>Fuzion safety</h1>\n\n<p>A main goal of Fuzion
      is to provide a development tool for safety-critical\napplications.  Fuzion
      brings a number of features that address safety issues at\ndifferent levels:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Language
      features</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>static typing</li>\n<li>language simplicity</li>\n<li>pre-
      and post-conditions for design by contract</li>\n<li>no wrap-around for standard
      operations +, -, *, /, etc.</li>\n<li>mutability restricted to local contexts</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>Run-time
      features</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>dynamic checks where static checks are not sufficient</li>\n<li>(real-time)
      garbage collection</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>Environment features</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>static
      linking to specific library versions</li>\n<li>static analysis tools</li>\n<li>no
      dynamic code loading</li>\n<li>simple intermediate representation, simpler tools</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h1>Conclusion
      and Next Steps</h1>\n\n<p>The Fuzion language definition and implementation
      are far from stable, but are\ngetting closer to become useful.  Big improvements
      come from the ability to\npre-compile modules and from the foreign language
      interface for Java, which\nmakes a giant code base accessible for Fuzion applications
      to build on.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, new projects such as the language server

    raw_description: "<h1>Introduction</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion is a modern general purpose
      programming language that unifies concepts\nfound in structured, functional
      and object-oriented programming languages into\nthe concept of a Fuzion feature.
      \ It combines a powerful syntax and safety\nfeatures based on the design-by-contract
      principle with a simple intermediate\nrepresentation that enables powerful optimizing
      compilers and static analysis\ntools to verify correctness aspects.</p>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      was influenced by many other languages including Java, Python, Eiffel,\nRust,
      Go, Lua, Kotlin, C#, F#, Nim, Julia, Clojure, C/C++, and many more.  The\ngoal
      of Fuzion is to define a language that has the expressive power present in\nthese
      languages and allow high-performance implementations and powerful analysis\ntools.
      \ Furthermore, Fuzion addresses requirements for safety-critical\napplications
      by adding support for contracts that enable formal specification and\nenable
      detailed control over run-time checks.</p>\n\n<p>Many current programming language
      are getting more and more overloaded with new\nconcepts and syntax to solve
      particular development or performance issues.\nLanguages like Java/C# provide
      classes, interfaces, methods, packages, anonymous\ninner classes, local variables,
      fields, closures, etc.  And these languages are\ncurrently further extended
      by the introductions of records/structs, value types,\netc.  The possibility
      of nesting these different concepts results in\ncomplexity for the developer
      and the tools (compilers, VMs) that process and\nexecute the code.</p>\n\n<p>For
      example, the possibility to access a local variable as part of the closure\nof
      a lambda expression may result in the compiler allocating heap space to hold\nthe
      contents of that local variable.  Hence, the developer has lost control over\nthe
      allocation decisions made by the compiler.</p>\n\n<p>In Fuzion, the concepts
      of classes, interfaces, methods, packages, fields and\nlocal variables are unified
      in the concept of a Fuzion feature. The decision\nwhere to allocate the memory
      associated with a feature (on the heap, the stack\nor in a register) is left
      to the compiler just as well as the decision if\ndynamic type information is
      needed.  The developer is left with the single\nconcept of a feature, the language
      implementation takes care of all the rest.</p>\n\n<h1>Fuzion Feature Declarations</h1>\n\n<p>A
      Fuzion feature has a name, similar to the name of a class or a function.\nThe
      main operation that can be performed on a feature is a feature call.  The\nconstituents
      of a feature declaration are as follows:</p>\n\n<h2>Formal Arguments</h2>\n\n<p>Features
      may have a list of formal arguments, which are themselves features\nimplemented
      as fields.  On a call to a feature with formal arguments, actual\narguments
      have to be provided to the call, unless the list of formal arguments\nis empty.</p>\n\n<h2>Feature
      Result</h2>\n\n<p>The result of a feature call is an instance of the feature.
      \ Alternatively, a\nfeature may declare a different result type, then it must
      return a value of that\ntype on a call.</p>\n\n<h2>Closures</h2>\n\n<p>Features
      are nested, i.e., every feature is declared within the context of an\nouter
      feature.  The only exception is the universe, which is the outermost\nfeature
      in Fuzion.  A feature can access features declared in its\nouter feature or,
      recursively, any outer feature of these outer features.  This\nmeans, a feature
      declaration also defines a closure of the feature and its\ncontext.</p>\n\n<p>When
      calling a feature <em>f1</em> declared as an inner feature of <em>f2</em>, the
      call must\ninclude a target value which is the result of a call to <em>f2</em>,
      e.g., <em>f2.f1</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Generics</h2>\n\n<p>Features may have generic
      type parameters. E.g. a feature declaration may leave\nthe actual type used
      within that feature open and to be defined by the user of\nthe feature.</p>\n\n<p>The
      list of generic type parameters may be open, i.e., the number of actual\ngeneric
      type parameters is not fixed at feature declaration.  This turns out to\nbe
      useful in the declaration of choice types and functions as explained below.</p>\n\n<h2>Inheritance</h2>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      features can inherit from one or several other features.  When inheriting\nfrom
      an existing features, all inner features of the parent automatically become\ninner
      features of the heir feature.  It is possible to redefine inherited\nfeatures.
      \ In particular, when inheriting from a feature with abstract inner\nfeatures,
      one can implement the inherited abstract features.</p>\n\n<p>A redefinition
      of an inherited feature may implement an inherited feature as a\nroutine or
      as a field.  An inherited feature that is implemented as a field,\nhowever,
      cannot be redefined as something else since fields might be mutable.</p>\n\n<p>Inheritance
      may result in conflicts. An example would be two features with the\nsame name
      that are inherited from two different parents.  In this case, the heir\nmust
      resolve the conflict either by redefining the inherited features and\nproviding
      a new implementation or by renaming the inherited features resulting\nin two
      inner features in the heir feature.</p>\n\n<p>Inheritance and redefinition in
      Fuzion does not require dynamic binding.  By\ndefault, the types defined by
      features are value types and no run-time overhead\nfor dynamic binding is imposed
      by inheritance.</p>\n\n<h2>A Contract</h2>\n\n<p>A feature may declare a contract
      that specifies what the features does and under\nwhich conditions the feature
      may be called.</p>\n\n<h2>An implementation</h2>\n\n<p>Features must have one
      of the following implementations</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>a routine is a feature
      implementation with code that is executed on a call</p></li>\n<li><p>a field
      is a memory slot that stores a value and whose contents are returned on a call</p></li>\n<li><p>an
      abstract feature has no implementation and cannot be called directly, but can
      be implemented by heir features</p></li>\n<li><p>an intrinsic feature is a low-level
      feature implemented by the compiler or\nrun-time system, e.g., the infix + operator
      to add two 32-bit integer values\nmay be an intrinsic operation.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>A
      feature implemented as a routine can contain inner feature declarations.</p>\n\n<h1>Feature
      examples</h1>\n\n<p>Here is an example that declares a feature <em>point</em>
      that functions similar to a\nstruct or record in other languages:</p>\n\n<pre><code>point(x,
      y i32) is # empty\np1 := point 3 4\nsay \"p1.x is {p1.x}\"    # will print \"p1.x
      is 3\"\nsay \"p1.y is {p1.y}\"    # will print \"p1.y is 4\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The
      next example shows a feature <em>base</em> that provides an inner feature <em>plus</em>\nthat
      adds its argument to the value passed to the enclosing base:</p>\n\n<pre><code>base(v
      i32) is\n  plus(w i32) =&gt; v + w\n\nb1 := base 30\nb2 := base 100\nsay (b1.plus
      23)    # will print \"53\"\nsay (b2.plus 23)    # will print \"123\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>Fuzion
      Syntax Evolution</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion provides two main syntax alternatives, a
      classic once using semicolons,\nbraces and parentheses and a modern one using
      white-space and indentation.  Both\nare equivalent, there should be tools between
      these two representations of\nsource code.  The following explains the main
      ideas how white-space is used\ninstead of special symbols</p>\n\n<h2>Separating
      Statements</h2>\n\n<h3>Flat line feeds instead of semicolons</h3>\n\n<p>The
      classic way to separate statements is by using a semicolon as in</p>\n\n<pre><code>stmt1;
      stmt2; stmt3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<pre><code>stmt1;\nstmt2;\nstmt3;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The
      Fuzion grammar knows a symbol called 'flat line feed', which is a line feed\nwith
      the next line starting with white space up to the previous line's\nindentation
      level. A 'flat line feed' is considered equivalent to a semicolon,\nso the sequence
      of three statements above can be written without semicolons as\nfollows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>stmt1\nstmt2\nstmt3\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Indenting
      line feeds to form blocks</h3>\n\n<p>Code blocks in Fuzion can be build using
      braces similar to many other languages</p>\n\n<pre><code>if cond { stmnt1 }
      else { stmnt2 }\n\nif cond {\n  stmnt1\n} else {\n  stmnt2\n}\n\nif cond\n  {\n
      \   stmnt1\n  }\nelse\n  {\n    stmnt2\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>An 'indenting
      line feed' in Fuzion is a line feed with the next line starting at\na higher
      indentation level.  The parser treats an 'indenting line feed' like a\nleft
      brace '{'. Correspondingly, a linefeed that reduces the indentation level\nback
      to the original level is treated like a right brace '}'. The example above\nis
      hence equivalent to</p>\n\n<pre><code>if cond\n  stmnt1\nelse\n  stmnt2\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally,
      an optional keyword 'then' may as well be used to separate an\nexpression like
      the condition in an 'if' from a following expression without the\nneed of braces:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if
      cond then stmnt1 else stmnt2\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Separating calls, arguments
      and operator expressions</h2>\n\n<h3>calls without parentheses</h3>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      calls do not need parentheses or commas to separate the called feature\nand
      its arguments, i.e., a call</p>\n\n<pre><code>f(a, b, c)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>can
      be written as</p>\n\n<pre><code>f a b c\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Parameters are
      then separated by white space. Line breaks, either flat or\nindenting as explained
      above, end the argument list.</p>\n\n<p>Parentheses may be needed for nesting
      calls with arguments, e.g., the code</p>\n\n<pre><code>f (g x y) (h z)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is
      equivalent to</p>\n\n<pre><code>f(g(x, y), h(z))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If placed
      in parentheses, operator expressions may extend over several lines\nusing an
      indenting line feed followed by additional flat line feeds, e.g.,</p>\n\n<pre><code>f
      (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +\n   5 + 6 + 7 + 8 +\n   9 + 10 + 11 + 12)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Tuples
      of values such as '(a, b)' syntactically look like argument lists.  A list\nof
      expressions enclosed in parentheses is treated as an argument list only if it\nimmediately
      follows the name of a called feature. The code</p>\n\n<pre><code>f(a, b)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>hence
      calls 'f' with two arguments 'a' and 'b'. In case there is white space\nafter
      the name of the called feature as in</p>\n\n<pre><code>f (a, b)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>the
      expression in parentheses is passed as an argument, so, in this case 'f'\nwill
      be called with a single argument: the tuple '(a, b)'.</p>\n\n<h3>Array indexing
      vs. array creation</h3>\n\n<p>The square brackets '[' and ‚Äô]‚Äô are used in Fuzion
      for two purposes: A\npre-initialized array of fixed size can be created using
      an expression like\n'[x, y, z]', while an array can be indexed using 'a[i]'.
      \ Again, white space can\nbe used to distinguish these two cases:</p>\n\n<pre><code>a[i]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>read
      an element from an array while</p>\n\n<pre><code>f [x, y, z]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>create
      array with elements x, y and z and passes it as an argument in a call to\n'f'.</p>\n\n<h3>Operator
      expressions</h3>\n\n<p>Operators are parsed as prefix- or postfix operators
      if the are not separated by\nwhite space from their target operand, but they
      are separated by white space on\nthe other side.  This means that the call</p>\n\n<pre><code>f
      -x\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is equivalent to</p>\n\n<pre><code>f (-x)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>while</p>\n\n<pre><code>f
      - x\nf-x\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>both subtract 'x' from 'f'. Furthermore,</p>\n\n<pre><code>f-
      x\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is parsed as</p>\n\n<pre><code>(f-) x\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>i.e.,
      it calls 'postfix -' on 'f' and, assuming the result is a function, calls\nthis
      result with one argument 'x'.</p>\n\n<p>The precedence of operators that are
      not separated by white space is stronger\nthan that of a call, so</p>\n\n<pre><code>f
      a-b\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is equivalent to</p>\n\n<pre><code>f (a-b)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>while
      the precedence of calls is higher than that of operators separated by\nwhite
      space, i.e,</p>\n\n<pre><code>f a -b\nf a - b\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>are equivalent
      to</p>\n\n<pre><code>f (a) (-b)\n(f a) - b\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>respectively.</p>\n\n<h2>White
      space vs. explicit tokens</h2>\n\n<p>Attaching semantics to white space might
      appear dangerous and error-prone to\nthose not used to it.  However, more and
      more languages (Python, Scala-3, Nim,\nRaku, ...) make use of white-space and
      the experience is generally very positive,\nthe code is cleaner, easier to read
      an even easier to maintain.  Compiler errors\ncomplaining about unbalanced parentheses
      or braces are gone and mismatch between\nindentation and semantics may no longer
      occur.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, even languages like Java allow code to have hugely
      different\nsemantics if just a single white space is added, e.g., the Java code</p>\n\n<pre><code>if
      (cc) x(); elsey();\nif (cc) x(); else y();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>changes completely
      by insertion of a single space character.</p>\n\n<h1>Fuzion Type Inference</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      is statically typed, every expression, every field, every routine result\nhas
      a static type known at compile time.  Type inference is used to avoid the\nneed
      to specify these types explicitly in many situations, reducing the\nboilerplate
      code while keeping the safety of a statically types language.</p>\n\n<p>Type
      inference in Fuzion occurs at explicit or implicit assignments. An explicit\nassignment
      is a field declaration with an initial value such as</p>\n\n<pre><code>v :=
      expr\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>while an implicit assignment occurs, e.g., when a
      routine returns the value of\nits last expression as its result</p>\n\n<pre><code>sum
      (x, y u32) =&gt;\n  x + y\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or when an argument is passed
      to a function</p>\n\n<pre><code>sum 1.234e6 567890\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Type
      inference occurs in two directions: From the value to the field that the\nvalue
      is assigned to and from the type of the assigned field to the value.\nField
      declarations using ':=' without an explicit type use the type inferred\nfrom
      the value, the same holds for routines defined using '=>'.</p>\n\n<p>On the
      other hand, the type of expressions such as lambdas or numeric literals are\ninferred
      from what they are assigned to.</p>\n\n<h2>Type inference from expressions to
      feature result type</h2>\n\n<p>When declaring either a field using ':=' or a
      routine using '=>', the result\ntype is inferred from the expression that is
      assigned or returned, respectively:</p>\n\n<pre><code>v := 123                    #
      type i32, default type for integer literal\nv := \"hello\"                #
      type string\nhighNibble(b u8) =&gt; b &gt;&gt; 4  # type u8\norigin =&gt; point
      0 0         # type point\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Type inference from expressions
      to type arguments</h2>\n\n<p>Type arguments are inferred from actual arguments
      as shown by the following\nexample: Imagine a generic routine <em>square</em>
      as follows</p>\n\n<pre><code>square&lt;T: integer&lt;T&gt;&gt; (a T) =&gt; a
      * a\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This could be called using explicit type arguments
      as in</p>\n\n<pre><code>say (square&lt;i32&gt; 23)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or the
      type can be inferred from the argument type</p>\n\n<pre><code>say (square 23)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As
      a consequence, type arguments can be omitted in many cases.</p>\n\n<h2>Type
      inference for lambdas</h2>\n\n<p>In Fuzion, inline functions (lambdas) are defined
      using '->' with the input\nvariables on the left and the expression on the right.
      \ Types for a lambda are\nimplicitly taken from the target the lambda is assigned
      to. E.g., the following\nexample takes a function argument</p>\n\n<pre><code>print(s
      string, f (string, i32) -&gt; string) =&gt;\n  say (f s 3)\n\nprint(f (i32,
      i32) -&gt; i32) =&gt;\n  say (f 10 3)\n\nprint \"Alice\" (s,i -&gt; s * i)   #
      lambda type is (string, i32) -&gt; string\nprint \"Bob\"   (s,i -&gt; s + i)\nprint
      (s,i -&gt; s * i)           # lambda type is (i32, i32) -&gt; i32\nprint (s,i
      -&gt; s + i)\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Type inference for numeric constants</h2>\n\n<p>Numeric
      constants that are assigned to a given type inherit that type.  There is\nno
      immediate distinction between plain numeric literals like '123' or ones using\na
      fractional parts and exponents such as '-0.1234E4'. The target type determines\nthe
      type of the constant.</p>\n\n<pre><code>v1 u32 := 123456\nv2 i8 := -128\nv3
      i16 := 32000\nv4 u64 := 1000000000000000000\nv5 i64 := -1000000000000000000\nv6
      u16 := 4711\nv7 f32 := 123456\nv8 f64 := 123.456E6\nv9 f64 := 1.0E3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In
      case the constant is too large for the target\ntype, or it has a fractional
      part not representable by the type, a compile-time\nerror occurs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>v1
      u32 := -123456       # error: negative value assigned to unsigned\nv2 i32 :=
      3000000000    # error: value too large\nv3 i8  := 128           # error: value
      too large\nv4 u16 := 65536         # error: value too large\nv5 f32 := 123.456E39
      \   # error: overflow\nv7 f64 := 123.456E309   # error: overflow\nv8 f32 :=
      7E-46         # error: underflow\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>Fuzion Intermediate Files</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      uses intermediate files during different stages of compilation: module\nfiles
      that contain library code, application files for whole applications and\nFuzion
      intermediate representation files that serve as input to the back ends.</p>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      uses a simple intermediate code to represent pre-compiled modules and\nwhole
      applications. This intermediate code serves as the input for static\nanalysis
      tools, optimizers and for different back-ends that produce executable\napplications.
      \ The goal in the design of the intermediate file format was high\nperformance
      and simplicity for tools using this code.</p>\n\n<p>The intermediate code is
      a binary format containing features and types in a way\nthat may be mapped to
      memory and used directly, so overhead of parsing this\nformat into an in-memory
      representation is avoided.  In particular, if only parts\nof a pre-compiled
      module are used by an application, there is no need to read and\nunpack parts
      of the module intermediate representation that are not used.</p>\n\n<p>For features
      containing code, a very simple stack-based format is used. There\nare currently
      only ten different instructions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Unit -- produce a value of
      unit type</li>\n<li>Current -- produce the current instance as a value</li>\n<li>Constant
      -- produce a constant value</li>\n<li>Assign -- perform an assignment to a field</li>\n<li>Call
      -- perform a call to a given feature</li>\n<li>Tag -- convert a value into a
      tagged value of a choice type</li>\n<li>Match -- match a choice type</li>\n<li>Box
      -- convert a value type to a ref type</li>\n<li>Unbox -- extract the value from
      a ref type</li>\n<li>Pop -- drop the top element from the stack</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>The
      intermediate code uses indices to refer to features and types within\nintermediate
      files.  This means that lookup is very efficient, but it also means\nthat a
      change in a library module requires recompilation of all dependent\nmodules.
      \ Any incompatibilities would be found at compile time instead of\nresulting
      in something like Java's 'IncompatibleClassChangeError' at run-time.</p>\n\n<h1>Foreign
      language interface</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion provides a tool 'fzjava' that takes a Java
      module file and converts it\ninto Fuzion features.  In the spirit of Fuzion,
      Java's packages, classes,\ninterfaces, methods, constructors, static methods
      and fields are all converted\ninto Fuzion features.  Java methods that may throw
      an exception are\nconverted into features resulting in a choice type that is
      either the exception\ntype or the result type of that method.</p>\n\n<p>A few
      intrinsic functions in the Java interpreter back-end use Java's reflection\nAPI
      to access the corresponding Java code.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a example how Java
      code can be used from Fuzion:</p>\n\n<pre><code>javaString := java.lang.String.new
      \"Hello Java \U0001F30D!\"                          # create Java string, type
      Java.java.lang.String\njavaBytes  := javaString.getBytes \"UTF8\"                                     #
      get its UTF8 bytes, type is fuzion.java.Array&lt;i8&gt;\nmatch javaBytes\n  err
      error =&gt; say \"got an error: $err\"\n  bytes fuzion.java.Array =&gt;\n    say
      \"string has {bytes.count} bytes: $bytes\"\n    javaString2 := java.lang.String.new
      bytes 6 bytes.count-6                # create Java string from bytes subset,\n
      \   say \"Hello \"+javaString2                                                 #
      append Java string to Fuzion string and print it\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>C back-end</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      now has a back-end that produces C source code to be compiled to machine\ncode
      using clang and LLVM.</p>\n\n<h1>Fuzion safety</h1>\n\n<p>A main goal of Fuzion
      is to provide a development tool for safety-critical\napplications.  Fuzion
      brings a number of features that address safety issues at\ndifferent levels:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Language
      features</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>static typing</li>\n<li>language simplicity</li>\n<li>pre-
      and post-conditions for design by contract</li>\n<li>no wrap-around for standard
      operations +, -, *, /, etc.</li>\n<li>mutability restricted to local contexts</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>Run-time
      features</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>dynamic checks where static checks are not sufficient</li>\n<li>(real-time)
      garbage collection</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>Environment features</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>static
      linking to specific library versions</li>\n<li>static analysis tools</li>\n<li>no
      dynamic code loading</li>\n<li>simple intermediate representation, simpler tools</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h1>Conclusion
      and Next Steps</h1>\n\n<p>The Fuzion language definition and implementation
      are far from stable, but are\ngetting closer to become useful.  Big improvements
      come from the ability to\npre-compile modules and from the foreign language
      interface for Java, which\nmakes a giant code base accessible for Fuzion applications
      to build on.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, new projects such as the language server
      implementation for Fuzion\nby Michael Lill help by integrating Fuzion support
      in popular IDEs and editors.</p>\n\n<p>Main points that are missing right now
      are</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a powerful standard library</li>\n<li>additional library
      modules for all sorts of application needs</li>\n<li>low-level foreign language
      interface for C</li>\n<li>actual implementations of static analyzers and optimizers</li>\n<li>highly
      optimizing back-ends</li>\n<li>garbage collection for the C back-end</li>\n<li>documentation,
      tutorials</li>\n<li>enthusiastic contributors and users!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Please
      feel free to contact me in case you want to use Fuzion or want to help\nmaking
      it a success!</p>"

      <p>There are plenty of tools that can analyze data in many ways, but just a few of them try to visualize this data beyond 2D. This is the goal of BabiaXR, a set of front-end modules for 3D VR (virtual reality) data visualization. The visualization part of BabiaXR is based on A-Frame and Threejs, providing a collection of components for creating different kinds of visualizations. Among them there are common ones like bar charts, pie charts, bubbles chart, but now we are moving beyond that, exploring new ways of showing data in 3D. For example, we are working on representing software projects using the city metaphor, showing the evolution of the project as the evolution of a city, with building corresponding to the different files. In this talk, I will do an overview of BabiaXR, showing different examples of the power of WebVR and A-Frame with different visualizations. Then, I will analyze a city corresponding to a well-known FOSS project, showing its evolution in different time snapshots and explaining how the code evolves as the city does. Moreover, there will be examples that the public of the room can try on the fly in their devices, and I will bring a set of two different VR devices to show the examples in an immersive environment after the talk.</p>

      <p>As A-Frame was developed in part by Mozilla developers, and it is used in some Mozilla services (such as Hubs), I think that it is interesting to show what kind of things, beyond games, can be done with this awesome framework, specifically, related to data analysis and new different ways of data visualization, like the cities that you can build with BabiaXR.</p>

      <p>Some languages offer a very simple syntax for testing via assertion statements, for example with an <code>assert</code> function that creates a simple test that passes if given a true value and fails for anything else.  This style of testing is admirably concise, but can lead to cryptic test messages that make it very difficult to determine what a test was attempting to check without opening up the file containing the failing test.  At the other extreme, it's possible to write very expressive tests with a fluent, method-chaining API.  For example, using the Chai.js assertion library, a test might read <code>beverages.should.have.property('tea').with.lengthOf(3)</code>.  This allows tests to automatically generate much more useful messages but comes at the cost of creating a fairly complex test API with many new methods to learn.</p>

      <p>Raku's core Test module falls somewhere between these two extremes ‚Äì it offers an API with a handful of functions that's easier to learn than a full fluent API but more expressive than simple <code>assert</code> statements.  This is a sensible compromise.</p>

      <p>But I claim (assert?) that, with a bit of metaprogramming trickery, Raku lets us have the best of both worlds: we can have a zero-learning-curve test API that's just as simple as assert statements while <em>also</em> being just as expressive as a long chain of method calls in a fluent style.  I'll present this style of testing, discuss its use in Raku, and consider ways in which Raku lets us improve on the status quo.</p>

      <p>Presentation of the main components behind gLean - a knowledge-management application which treats problem-domains as a collection of blocks. gLeans USP is in choosing terse components which syntactically do not impede eachother - permitting collections of block to be parsed and interpreted with minimal concerns for complexity. The hope is that gLean will be able to provide YahooPipes style functionality through combining blocks of references; content; annotations; and parsing-logic.</p>

      <p>Given the proposal of a 15 mins timeframe (I can do more, just ask) the following areas will be covered:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>The talk extols the virtue of the individual components (Gemini protocol's GemText; Emacs-Hyperbole's Kotl; the parser and Lisp, TXR; Jonathan McHugh's Qiuy (a 'Recursive Modelling Language')) as exemplary specialist utilities.</p></li>
      <li><p>Examples for how Kotl format and GemText markdown can interoperate (to for instance turning a file into representative Kotl blocks; or export Kotl blocks into GemText)</p></li>
      <li><p>The beautiful/unholy ability for TXR to read a 'raw' GemText file containing TXR syntax and for a 'compiled' GemText file to emerge (given this unintended behaviour requires no additional coding and was not designed I consider this particularly special)</p></li>

      <p>In the light of increasing importance of supply chain security, obtaining detailed and accurate Software Bills of Material (SBOMs) for software images is fundamentally important. In this talk, we will present a tool called SBOM Resolver which generates detailed SBOMs for Alpine software images. It specifically leverages meta-data from the Alpine package management system to resolve all dependencies of a list of desired packages and enhances the resulting SBOM with additional information such as patches applied by the Alpine community.</p>

      <p>The current implementation is specific to Alpine, however, this presentation aims to introduce the key concepts and based on those start a discussion of how to apply SBOM Resolver to other distributions.</p>

      <p>In this talk, I will show you how to build and deploy ply (a dynamic tracing language for eBPF) to a BeagleBone Black then write ply scripts to attach probes and tracepoints to a running kernel and application on that same target. eBPF has rapidly eclipsed all previous tracers for Linux. While eBPF has taken the cloud native community by storm, the technology has yet to make significant inroads within the embedded Linux ecosystem. I will explain the reasons for this current situation and demonstrate a possible way forward.</p>

      <p>The bpftrace dynamic tracing language relies on the LLVM-based BCC toolchain to compile scripts down to eBPF bytecode. Because of its dependency on LLVM, BCC only supports a few 64-bit CPU architectures, severely limiting the use of eBPF in embedded systems. Fortunately, the IO Visor Project offers a lightweight alternative to bpftrace called ply. Like bpftrace, ply‚Äôs syntax is inspired by both DTrace and awk. Unlike bpftrace, ply targets embedded CPU architectures like ARM and PowerPC making it possible to deploy eBPF to many more devices. Buildroot includes ply as of its 2021.02 LTS release.</p>

      <p>While writing a Z80 emulator, you might ask yourself: should it be 100% accurate ? Maybe not, if you just want to run old software. But what if you're not and this old software accidentally depends on undocumented behavior ?
      In this talk we'll explore how, 30 years after its design, a few people on a Russian retro-computing forum reverse engineered an undocumented Z80 register: MEMPTR. And how 6 years later, another even less known secret register was discovered.</p>

      <p>Some proposals exist to that offer a solutions to this problem (e.g. FOSDEM 2012: ‚ÄúAdding 16-bit Character Support in LLVM‚Äù or https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2019-May/132080.html: ‚ÄúOn removing magic numbers assuming 8-bit bytes‚Äù).

      <p>Only the modification of the character alignment to 64-bits is allowed. With modifying only 8 files (some of them only dealing with character assertions) we end up with the desired result of:</p>

      <p>This solutions can also easily be adopted to machines with a minimal addressable unit of 16- or 32-bits. Also ‚ÄúWChar‚Äù can be addressed with minimal changes.</p>

    abstract: <p>FPGAs are increasingly being used in today's embedded systems. But
      they are notoriously complex for having a difficult programming model. In order
      to counter this complexity, there has been a growing focus to design FPGA hardware
      at a higher level of abstraction with new languages and compilers. This talk
      will serve as "one stop shop" for topics related to these developments.</p>
    description: <p>Are you an embedded developer? Do you like FPGAs? Do you want
      to know the best programming practices for embedded systems that deploy FPGAs?  Do
      you like economical hardware? Do you like open source projects? If your answer
      is "yes" to either of the aforementioned questions, then this talk is for you.
      As the title goes, this talk and its content will actually be "one stop shop"
      for best practices related to FPGA programming. Considering C-based languages
      still dominate the embedded systems, the talk will focus on new methodologies
      that can be broadly implemented while using all C-based (C/C++/C#) languages
      when it comes to implement your designs on FPGAs. To take it further, the talk
      will shift focus on C++ as C++ is finally picking up pace to come even more
      closer to low level hardware as compared to previous C++ standards. The last
      four C++ standards have come a long way to make C++ language even more compatible
      with embedded systems. Many open source FPGA libraries are based on modern C++.
      At the end of the day, you will know how a modern embedded developer can adopt
      certain coding practices to fully exploit the underlying spatial parallelism
      of FPGA hardware. Additionally, you will learn about open source compilers,
      open source projects, and economical FPGAs hardware to implement these best
      practices.</p>

      <p>Hardware acceleration has become prevalent in most application domains as a means to increase performance, while also achieving high energy efficiency. However, the programming models for heterogeneous hardware accelerators inherently support C/C++, thereby hindering the exploitation of heterogeneous resources from managed languages, such as Java. In the University of Manchester, we have been developing  TornadoVM; an open-source software technology that can be used as a plugin to OpenJDK and other JVM distributions to enable hardware acceleration in a programmer friendly manner.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we will present a practical view of TornadoVM and focus on two parts: (i) analyze what can impact the performance of applications on heterogeneous co-processors, and (ii) how Java developers can utilize TornadoVM to increase the performance of their applications.</p>

      <p>Humanities data are interesting (both technically and to the public). They are rich in text, images, objects, people and events, heterogeneous, eminently linkable and sparse-matrix. Personal computers, the internet and other accessible technologies have spawned an exploding field (or fad?) known as Digital Humanities (DH), and opened exciting new horizons for research and public engagement.</p>

      <p>However, this technological turn has created many problems for a poorly funded research culture with 1-3 year grant funding cycles - choice of appropriate technology, finding and retaining technical staff, initial and ongoing costs, sustainability ... The outcome is often least-effort and inadequate technology (eg. spreadsheets) or ad hoc development, incomplete functionality, maintenance nightmares, data silos and rapid end-of-funding decay; only rich or statutory organisations can maintain a multi-component system for long. Heurist aims to overcome these problems by mutualised Open Source development, schemas stored as editable data rather than fixed structures, demand-driven priority development, and free centralised services and maintenance.</p>

      <p>In this presentation I will outline the evolution of our development process, from haphazard experimentation and many costly unused features (2005 - 2009) to a coherent, stable but evolving structure and Extreme Programming (aka living dangerously!), driven by immediate user requirements and incremental daily interface refinement.

      <p>The Matrix core team is busier than ever, juggling hundreds of Matrix Spec Core Proposals and undergoing some major techtonic shifts as Matrix evolves into the ultimate secure decentralised communication network.  In this talk, we'll give a high-level survey of the state of the core project, including:
       * How we're ensuring that flagship clients are as attractive as possible to a mainstream audience - and why we will fail if we don't.
       * How we're making Matrix go <em>fast</em> via v3 sync and fast room joins
       * How matrix-rust-sdk is becoming a flagship client SDK
       * How we're getting a full end-to-end security of the reference Matrix stack
       * How we're tackling abuse on the public Matrix network
       * How Matrix is evolving to use cases beyond chat.</p>

      <p>During FOSDEM 2021, we presented in the same event the LUMI supercomputer and we discussed about the Open Software Platform for GPU-accelerated Computing by AMD (ROCm) ecosystem, how to port CUDA codes to Heterogeneous Interface for Portability (HIP), and some performance results based on the utilization of NVIDIA V100 GPU. In this talk we assume the audience is familiar with the content of the previous presentation.
        One year later, we have executed many codes on AMD MI100 GPU, tuned the performance on various codes and benchmarks, utilized and tuned a few programming models such as HIP, OpenMP offloading, Kokkos, and hipSYCL on AMD MI100 and compared their performance additionally with NVIDIA V100 and NVIDIA A100 (including CUDA). Furthermore, a new open source software is released by AMD, called GPUFort, to port Fortran+CUDA/OpenACC codes to Fortran+HIP for AMD GPUs. In this talk we present what we learned through our experience, how we tune the codes for MI100, how we expect to tune them in the future for LUMI GPU, the AMD MI250X, compare the previously mentioned programming models on some kernels across the GPUs, present a performance comparison for single precision benchmark, discuss the updated software roadmap, and a brief update for the porting workflow.</p>

      <p>We'll go over how 1 to 1 calls work in Matrix today, our Jitsi widget we've used for group calls so far, and the changes we've made to support native group calls in Matrix. We'll also show off some early concepts for our "Metaverse on Matrix" project, Third Room. Which uses this group call work as well as many other open standards to build a platform for virtual worlds on top of Matrix rooms.</p>

      <p>I have been organizing open-source related meetups and conferences for more than a decade. The past two years have been exceptionally trying. Any guesses as to why that is? :)</p>

      <p>In this session, I will share our experiences from the 6 online Ansible Contributor Summits that we have held through 2020-2021. While the virtual platform gave us more flexibility in many ways (such as having 3 events in a year instead of the usual 1), it definitely presented many new challenges as well. From pre-event marketing to technologies used during the summits, post-event surveys + feedback that feed into the next event, it's a continuous cycle of trials, errors, and improvements.</p>

      <p>There is also a major shift towards using open source tools and workflows for the summits, at the request of some community memebers as well as the desire within our team. I'll share what fell short and what thrived, and how the changes impacted not just conference management for our team, but also how the Ansible community received these events. Because at the end of the day, these conferences are for the community contributors and participants!</p>

      <p>So you‚Äôve done some user testing or usability testing as an open source software team and now you have interesting user insights collected. But...what do you do with it? How does user feedback correspond to issues in the backlog? How do you get the wider OSS community team up to speed if they haven‚Äôt been part of the synthesis process? These are some of the questions you may ask yourself after participating in user testing or usability testing. You‚Äôre ready for a synthesis process!</p>

      <p>The USABLE team has already published two resources about user testing and usability testing, now they are presenting their third resource about user insight synthesis. You‚Äôll see how they supported open source software tool teams to work with user insights in an open source way of user testing, usability and synthesis work.
      In this session you will observe how the USABLE team supported OSS tool teams with user insight synthesis processes with detailed explanations of why, how and when to do synthesis. You will also view clips of a previous closed session in which the USABLE team and OSS tool teams collaborated on a synthesis work session.</p>

      <p>The concerns about code complexity, cybersecurity and LTS have made a continuous testing infrastructure a must have.</p>

      <p>The tests must take place both in virtual and real target. Virtual target because developers never get enough physical boards to test from, and real in order to limit virtualization/reality deviation.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>With the exponential growth of software complexity, to keep the cost and time of critical embedded application development under control, a continuous testing infrastructure is a must have feature.</p>

      <p>Not only should software tests be run early and automatically each time a developer pushes a new code commit in the system, but tests should also be run in a virtualized environment because developers typically never get enough physical board to test from. Nevertheless we should keep enough real hardware in the loop to limit virtualization/reality deviation and ensure developers can transparently move test from virtualization to the real world.</p>

      <p>This presentation shows how virtualization can ensure early code integration to reduce development/testing cycle, while at the same time keeping track with real hardware to ensure that  application is also running correctly on the final production device.  Then it gives feedback on the different challenges Iot.bzh faced while deploying its continuous tests infrastructure. Finally it focuses on the way virtualization and real targets can be combined to offer developers a complete and efficient CI infrastructure.</p>

      <p>The concerns about code complexity, cybersecurity and LTS have made a continuous testing infrastructure a must have.</p>

      <p>The tests must take place both in virtual and real target. Virtual target because developers never get enough physical boards to test from, and real in order to limit virtualization/reality deviation.</p>
    raw_description: |-
      <p>With the exponential growth of software complexity, to keep the cost and time of critical embedded application development under control, a continuous testing infrastructure is a must have feature.</p>

      <p>Not only should software tests be run early and automatically each time a developer pushes a new code commit in the system, but tests should also be run in a virtualized environment because developers typically never get enough physical board to test from. Nevertheless we should keep enough real hardware in the loop to limit virtualization/reality deviation and ensure developers can transparently move test from virtualization to the real world.</p>

      <p>This presentation shows how virtualization can ensure early code integration to reduce development/testing cycle, while at the same time keeping track with real hardware to ensure that  application is also running correctly on the final production device.  Then it gives feedback on the different challenges Iot.bzh faced while deploying its continuous tests infrastructure. Finally it focuses on the way virtualization and real targets can be combined to offer developers a complete and efficient CI infrastructure.</p>

      <p>OpenEmbedded, Zephyr and meta-zephyr are powerful tools that can give IoT

      <p>In this talk, pidge is going to show changes being implemented through her work
      on the Eclipse Oniro project to the meta-zephyr layer that bring most zephyr
      supported machine configurations into meta-zephyr but also removes the need for
      OE machine  configurations to have any knowledge of core zephyr modules. She will

      <p>RAUC is a popular solution for A/B updates of embedded Linux devices because of its flexibility, safety and security features. It supports industry-leading build system: Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded, Buildroot and PTXdist. Upgrades are performed through RAUC bundles which can be installed either through the network or just using a USB stick.</p>

      <p>To port RAUC to a new device, we need to go through several steps: setup appropriate bootloader like U-Boot, enable SquashFS in the Linux kernel configurations, use ext4 file system, create partitions and configure RAUC slots, generate certificates and setup bootloader environment configurations with a script to switch RAUC slots over upgrades. To simplify the getting started process of developers using RAUC with Yocto and OpenEmbedded in 2020 Leon Anavi created layer meta-rauc-community. In 2021 the layer was moved to the RAUC organization in GitHub. Initially it offered only Raspberry Pi support and over the time, thanks to numerous community contributions, the support was extended to more machines. As of the moment meta-rauc-community provides RAUC sample integrations for Raspberry Pi, Sunxi (Allwinner), QEMUx86 and NVIDIA Jetson TX2.</p>

      <p>This presentation will provide a brief introduction to RAUC and will focus on layers meta-rauc and meta-rauc-community. We will go through the exact steps how build, flash and update an image using bitbake to the currently supported platforms. Furthermore we will discuss general guidelines for porting RAUC and adding new supported machines to meta-rauc-community in the future.</p>

      <p>The talk is appropriate for anyone with basic knowledge about Linux. It will hopefully help other software developers in the community to overcame faster and easier similar technical difficulties while integrating the RAUC client on embedded Linux devices and hopefully contribute back to the Yocto/OpenEmbedded layer meta-rauc-community.</p>

      <p>Free/Open source Research Software production at the Gaspard-Monge Computer Science laboratory - Lessons learnt

      <p>we have analyzed the evolution of several problems that rise when considering the Research Software (RS) production of a laboratory, and we have highlighted several issues that should be addressed to deal with these problems within the Open Science context. Among them we have called to the establishment of sound dissemination and evaluation procedures following the guidelines of the CDUR RS assessment protocol presented in:</p>

      <p>CDUR comprises four steps that can be succinctly described as follows:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Citation, to deal with correct RS identification,</li>
      <li>Dissemination, to measure good dissemination practices,</li>
      <li>Use, devoted to the evaluation of usability aspects, and</li>
      <li>Research, to assess the impact of the scientific work.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>In this talk we would like to analyze more in depth RS dissemination and  evaluation issues and the above mentioned protocols, referring, in particular, to how these protocols can be adapted to different situations that may appear in evaluation processes such as, for example, different evaluation contexts (career, review...).</p>

      <p>We will also highlight the interconnections that link both dissemination and evaluation issues, as the RS dissemination needs to adjust to evaluation rules and only suitably disseminated RS (maybe in a restricted context) can be evaluated.</p>

      <p>In the Eclipse Oniro project, a distributed OS for consumer electronics,
      we're proposing a collection of "blueprints" use cases and their implementations
      using embedded software on reference hardware.</p>

      <p>Today, we are going to explain our motivations for the blueprints' approach
      and of course how to replicate and deploy firmware from sources and
      why Oniro can be flexible to create the device of your dream.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Oniro is an ambitious Eclipse project,
      one of its challenges is to defragment existing IoT ecosystems.</p>

      <p>To target a bigger heterogeneous range of IoT devices,
      openness, flexibility, and interoperability,
      should be enabled at the Operating System level.</p>

      <p>Since the beginning of this versatile OS development,
      a complementary blueprint concept was introduced
      to be more aligned with different aspects of the software and hardware industry.</p>

      <p>Blueprints are standalone projects that are addressing specific uses cases
      by providing "semi final integration" that would make use of the underneath technology.</p>

      <p>Those minimal viable products are not only used for demonstration or validation purposes,
      but they can serve as a base to create production-ready solutions.
      Blueprints also could inspire devices makers to address similar or more sophisticated use cases.</p>

      <p>Today as we speak, our reference blueprints include
      a vending machine, an IoT gateway, a door lock, keypad and more.</p>

      <p>The results of our work are going to be demonstrated and we will be presenting
      what is common and what differs.</p>

      <p>Each of those achievements are targeting different uses case and different environments,
      but many steps can be factorized from building process, customization to
      security or IP compliance scanning.</p>

      <p>Expect to see demos on how our Oniro project leverages other opensource projects
      like Yocto/OE Embedded distribution, Linux and Zephyr Kernel, LVGL UI toolkit,
      OpenThread mesh networking, Web of Things and more.</p>

      <p>To target a bigger heterogeneous range of IoT devices,
      openness, flexibility, and interoperability,
      should be enabled at the Operating System level.</p>

      <p>Since the beginning of this versatile OS development,
      a complementary blueprint concept was introduced
      to be more aligned with different aspects of the software and hardware industry.</p>

      <p>Blueprints are standalone projects that are addressing specific uses cases
      by providing "semi final integration" that would make use of the underneath technology.</p>

      <p>Those minimal viable products are not only used for demonstration or validation purposes,
      but they can serve as a base to create production-ready solutions.
      Blueprints also could inspire devices makers to address similar or more sophisticated use cases.</p>

      <p>Today as we speak, our reference blueprints include
      a vending machine, an IoT gateway, a door lock, keypad and more.</p>

      <p>The results of our work are going to be demonstrated and we will be presenting
      what is common and what differs.</p>

      <p>Each of those achievements are targeting different uses case and different environments,
      but many steps can be factorized from building process, customization to
      security or IP compliance scanning.</p>

      <p>Expect to see demos on how our Oniro project leverages other opensource projects
      like Yocto/OE Embedded distribution, Linux and Zephyr Kernel, LVGL UI toolkit,
      OpenThread mesh networking, Web of Things and more.</p>

    abstract: "<p>This talk presents OpenNebula's new distributed Edge Cloud Architecture,
      which is composed of Edge Clusters that can run any workload (both Virtual Machines
      and application containers), on any resource (bare-metal or virtualized), anywhere
      (on-prem and on a cloud/edge provider). An Edge Cluster, built on open source
      technologies that already exist in the Linux operating system, is a hyperconverged
      functional set of managed objects that include storage, network, and host resources.
      An Edge Cluster provides all the resources needed to run virtualized or containerized
      applications. OpenNebula‚Äôs management services, including scheduling, monitoring
      and life-cycle management, run in the cloud Front-end and orchestrate from there
      the local or remote Edge Clusters. The Front-end also provides access to the
      administration tools, user interfaces, and API. Although the requirements may
      vary depending on the number and size of the clusters and API load, the Front-end
      node only requires 8 GB of main memory and 4 cores. The Edge Cloud Architecture
      is able to provide a lightweight and easy-to-use storage platform for medium-sized
      clusters consisting of tens of nodes. OpenNebula‚Äôs Edge Cloud Architecture is
      able to manage hundreds of these clusters, as they operate autonomously in terms
      of networking and storage, and handle thousands of virtualized hosts and tens
      of thousands of virtualized applications. In this presentation we will explain
      in detail the deployment model for Edge Clusters, the specialized storage solution
      they incorporate (OneStor), and the performance benefits of this multi-cloud
      architecture as confirmed by the latest benchmarks.</p>"

      <p>Unikernels are hard to debug? Unikernels cannot be easily administrated or monitored? While unikernels have the potential to revolutionize our infrastructures and take cloud computing into the next era, many worry that unikernels cannot be seamlessly integrated into today‚Äôs development and production workflows.
      At the Unikraft team, we are heavily working on addressing these concerns and changing the status quo. Although unikernels are monolithic bundles of only necessary kernel functions and an application, we follow the concept that everything is a (micro-)library. Users can pick and choose kernel functionality at build time. The same applies for monitoring and debugging: In this talk, we will give an overview of our current debugging and monitoring capabilities, and we will present our vision for how these pieces will enable a cloud-native experience. We will also give a deep dive into our GDB backend implementation with a live demo.</p>

      <p>Software has become increasingly central to scientific research. Both software development and its use are essential activities for scientific teams. But investment in its production, maintenance, and adoption is often overlooked, and academia often fails to leverage best practices for software engineering from industry, the open source community, or elsewhere. Furthermore, investment in the user experience (UX) and usability of scientific software is largely an afterthought, if considered at all. As such, any future investment in UX is expected to have a disproportionately positive impact on adoption of scientific tools (i.e. broadening access) and on scientific discovery itself. Currently, the impact of this kind of investment (or lack thereof) is largely unknown.</p>

      <p>Scientific software stands to benefit from the learnings and current practices in open source design. This talk will explore the unique workflows and incentives of research institutions (and other contexts in which scientific software is produced) and map them to current practices of open source design with the intention of bringing to light the opportunities to better understand how and when to invest in the UX of research software, how to grow expertise in UX, and how to cultivate norms on peer-production platforms toward good UX practices.</p>

    description: |-
      <p>Android phones have long been plagued by being based on old versions of the Linux kernel which are seldom patched against vulnerabilities and other security flaws. Additionally being based on old versions which are most of the time not being maintained by anyone anymore a vendor has to evaluate if a given patch applies to the old kernel version they are using or not and modify the patch if necessary. This problem has been somewhat mitigated by closer collaboration between SoC vendors and the Linux kernel community (LTS kernels) but this only applies to drivers and components that are actually present in the main branch of the Linux kernel. Drivers only present in vendor-maintained branches often get left out of security and general bug fixes.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately for many companies there isn't a clear financial reason to clean up device drivers and submit them upstream, so in this talk I will give an introduction into how you can get started in making your device run a kernel that's based on mainline Linux.</p>

      <p>Running alternative operating systems (other than Android) on your phone is in some cases possible with the kernel provided by the vendor but in these cases you need to rely on solutions like libhybris to work with proprietary user space binaries and libraries to make hardware work. Running 100% open source software while using a vendor-provided kernel ("downstream kernel") is not feasible due to the sheer number of proprietary user space components that would need to be replaced. But with a mainline kernel you can get to a fully free and open source operating system for your phone. And this talk will give you can introduction to some of the basics in getting started with running mainline Linux kernel on your phone and some of the tips and tricks that I have learned over the years.</p>

      <p>The confidentiality and integrity guarantees offered by Intel SGX enclaves can be easily thwarted if the enclave has not been properly designed. Its interface with the untrusted software stack is a perhaps the largest attack surface that adversaries can exploit; unintended interactions with untrusted code can expose the enclave to memory corruption attacks, for instance.</p>

      <p>We have proposed a notion, called orderliness, that embodies good practice set out by academic papers and the principles of the Intel SGX SDK‚Äôs programming model.  It is concerned especially with these interactions between the trusted and untrusted worlds. This notion underpins Guardian: an open-source tool that we have created to help enclave developers check their enclaves are orderly before they are deployed. It automatically validates enclaves and reports violations to our notion of orderliness. These violations help find  parts of their code that may need changing ‚Äì they should usually point to an attack primitive.</p>

      <p>We have found some security issues in enclaves that had been extensively vetted by other researchers ‚Äì one of which was crafted by Intel engineers.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Modern processors can offer hardware primitives that allow a process to run in isolation. These primitives implement a trusted execution environment (TEE) in which a program can run in such a way that the integrity and confidentiality of its execution are guaranteed. Intel's Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) is an example of such primitives and its isolated processes are called enclaves. These guarantees, however, can be easily undermined if the enclave has not been properly designed.</p>

      <p>We propose a notion of an orderly enclave that splits the enclave‚Äôs behaviour into the following execution phases: entry, secure, ocall, and exit. Each of them imposes a set of restrictions that enforce a particular policy of access to untrusted memory and, in some cases, sanitisation conditions. A violation of these policies and conditions might indicate an undesired interaction with untrusted data/code or a lack of sanitisation, both of which can be harnessed to perpetrate attacks against the enclave. We also introduce Guardian: an open-source tool that uses symbolic execution to carry out the validation of an enclave against our notion of an orderly enclave; in this process, it also looks for some other typical attack primitives. We discuss how our approach can prevent and flag enclave vulnerabilities that have been identified in the literature. Moreover, we have evaluated how our approach fares in the analysis of some enclave samples. In this process, Guardian identified some previously undetected security issues in some of these samples.  These were subsequently acknowledged and fixed by the corresponding maintainers.</p>

      <p>Porting to the ARM (64-bit) architecture was relatively easy (and needed for some other projects).

Easy to hack but not that easy if you want to do it right. We needed to do something that doesn't go quite as far as OpenEmbedded/Yocto, but still is powerful enough to handle many different devices.
      Making the hardware work? Largely solved by the upstream community.
      Finding or developing apps for base functionality, and making them work for the phone form factor? Mostly solved (with a few caveats).
      But how can we work with Android and/or iOS apps (currently required to e.g. log in to most bank accounts)? How can we make this appealing to a normal user?</p>

      capability for starting hypervisors will be presented with a short discussion
      of the Xen implementation. The talk will progress to a discussion of how Hyperlaunch
      is connected with TrenchBoot (Linux Secure Launch) and Mandatory Access Control
      communication fabrics. With a focus on how it enables dedicated PCI management
      constructs that can provide secure and trustworthy isolation for PCI devices,
      with the potential for CXL devices. The talk will close with an open discussion
      on how hypervisors might unify around a common approach for IOMMU management.</p>"

      <p>Peer to peer to protocols (P2P) are useful for creating applications that are less reliant on central physical and digital infrastructure. With a p2p backend, an application can easily move between connecting people over the internet, to local and ad-hoc networks, and working entirely offline. We take this ability a step further by integrating several protocols into web browsers so that applications can be authored and distributed just like any other data in the network.</p>

      <p>This talk will go over some of these protocols, their strengths and weaknesses, and how we have applied them to the web. We'll also have a live demo of what it looks like as a developer.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>This talk will be using the desktop version of the open source Agregore Browser, a minimal web browser built on top of the Electron framework which deeply integrates several protocols everywhere that a browser might use a URL.</p>

      <p>The specific protocols we will be going over are IPFS, Hypercore-Protocol, and BitTorrent.</p>

      <p>We'll also be talking about the benefits of using P2P software in ad-hoc mesh networks and how it can enable communities to make the most of their local networks.</p>

      <p>Last year I moved to Tallinn, Estonia, which is known also by it's public transport system - free for city residents. It is so good, reliable and optimized, that I sold my car and use buses and trams exclusively for all my city travels.</p>

      <p>While planning a transit route is pretty straightforward with an official website, usually I need some transit-related information on the go. On a phone. And that's where both the website and many big and small apps show their imperfections. Download sizes, ads, user interface. Instead of focusing on my problems, I have to learn and work around apps' issues.</p>

      <p>As an open source developer, that seemed not an issue - but a challenge. I've made interactive maps for the past ten years, and I know one should not use these libraries with default settings. Nor one should ever rely on zooming. Could I made a map with apps that doesn't require more than a couple of taps to get all the needed information? How hard would it be to keep number of buttons and other interactive elements to minimum, while not sacrificing functions I need every day?</p>

      <p>Imagine you're an engineer at an ODM or OEM working on a IoT product for
      the smarthome - from a simple thermostat to security alarms, from set top
      boxes to internet gateways.</p>

      <p>Linux is a fairly obvious choice to build these product that have greater
      than 128MB of RAM and storage. On resource-constrained devices, an RTOS
      such as Zephyr is able to even run on devices with as little as a few
      hundred KB of RAM and storage.</p>

      <p>However, the kernel is a small part of the device's software stack - there
      is middleware, application frameworks, security policies, key management,
      OTA and multi-year maintenance that the company needs to budget into the
      device's engineering support costs.</p>

      <p>Viewing the Linux and RTOS ecosystems as two parts of a single product
      platform allows for a coherent view of both ecosystems by developers. You
      want to make sure that you can apply the same set of software
      configurations and policies across both ecosystems e.g. library versions,
      compatible protocol suites, security configurations, OTA mechanisms and
      even a single set of IP compliance tools.</p>

      <p>As an example, when you decide you want to secure all your network
      communications out-of-the-box in your product platform, you need to:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Find an SSL library that'll fit both footprints</li>
      <li>Configure it to have a coherent set of modern ciphers compatible across
      the two ecosystems</li>
      <li>Get the various protocol libraries to build against the chosen SSL
      library</li>
      <li>Create key provisioning tools that can work across the two ecosystems</li>
      <li>Perform interoperability tests</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Now repeat this exercise across every key component of the OS - security
      policy, networking features, OTA, toolchain hardening, IP compliance tools
      and you end up with a meta-project that spans and contributes to both
      ecosystems.</p>

      <p>We've started to build such a open product platform with opinionated
      defaults that follow community best practices with Eclipse Oniro. And
      this is our story about our plans for the future.</p>

      <p>Good questions lead to better answers.</p>

      <p>Asking good questions is a must have skill for software developers, especially if you are involved in open source projects. The problem with poor questions is clear when the person answering starts explaining what you already know or what you think isn't relevant. Or they might go ahead and assume that you know a lot and you end up being confused.</p>

      <p>In this talk, Navendu walks through his experience as an open source contributor and a maintainer and how he was able to improve this skill and how it has benefitted him.</p>

      <p>This quick session is for junior and senior developers alike and offers real examples and takeaways that you can start implementing right away.</p>

      <p>Debugging applications is an important part of the development process. However, error messages and general logging can leak sensitive data, and in some cases even compromise your whole stack, as developers worldwide have recently learned from the log4j vulnerability.</p>

      <p>With ConÔ¨Ådential Computing, the world gets much more complicated, as every piece of information that a malicious entity on the host (including the host itself!) can gather may be leaking vital information about your workload. This talk details some of the problems that arise, and discusses some options to address them whilst considering real life workloads and application lifecycles.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Log entries and other error messages can be very useful, but they can also provide information to other parties - sometimes information which you‚Äôd prefer they didn‚Äôt have.  This is particularly true when you are thinking about Confidential Computing: running applications or workloads in environments where you really want to protect the confidentiality and integrity of your application and its data.</p>

      <p>This talk examines some of the issues that we need to consider when designing Confidential Computing frameworks, the applications we run in them, and their operations. Designers and architects of the TEE infrastructure and even, to a lesser extent, of potential workloads themselves, need to consider very carefully the impact of host gaining access to messages associated with the workload and the infrastructure components.  It is, realistically, infeasible to restrict all communication to levels appropriate for deployment, so it is recommended that various profiles are created which can be applied to different stages of a deployment, and whose use is carefully monitored, logged (!) and controlled by process.</p>

      <p>Operating Systems (OSes) have historically been classified according to their isolation properties: monolithic OSes, microkernels, single-address-space OSes, or unikernels... Decades of experience in research and industry showed that there is no silver bullet and that different use-cases might demand different approaches to optimize safety and performance.</p>

      <p>What if we tried to design an operating system able to be easily reconfigured into any of these points in the OS design space? What if the OS could be a microkernel, a unikernel, or a monolithic OS, at will, and using a wide range of hardware- and software-backed isolation mechanisms?</p>

      <p>In this talk, we will present FlexOS, the result of our recent research work in trying to answer this question. FlexOS is an OS allowing users to easily specialize the safety and isolation strategy of an OS at compilation/deployment time, instead of design time. Depending on the configuration, the same FlexOS code can mimic a microkernel with multiple address-spaces, a single-address-space OS with Intel MPK compartments, or many other OS isolation approaches. We have implemented a prototype of FlexOS on top of Unikraft, a popular library OS framework.</p>

      <p>One of the core concepts of Crowdsec is to decorrelate the detection of an attack and its reaction, to be suitable for modern architectures.
      While Crowdsec is in charge of the detection, the reaction is performed by "bouncers" that aim to be deployable at any level of the applicative / infrastructure stack :
      ¬†- as a nftables/iptables daemon "a la fail2ban"

      ¬†- etc.</p>

      <p>We hope that this approach, combined with a declarative configuration and a stateless behaviour, will make it an ideal candidate to enhance the security of modern stacks (containers, k8s, serverless and more generally automatically deployed infrastructures).
      We are committed to building a strong community, with all that it implies :
      ¬†- <a href="https://hub.crowdsec.net">a public hub</a> to find, share and amend parsers, scenarios and bouncers.¬†- permissive open-source licence to stay business-friendly</p>

    description: |-
      <p>The Digital Markets Act introduces rules for "gatekeeper" digital companies, defining how to recognize them and setting obligations for them to fulfil. These obligations generally affect their business practices, such as the terms and conditions that they impose onto their business users and the consumers; the way they enter new markets and exploit their strength to conquer them; the opportunities that are left for users to choose competing services or move out of the walled gardens. Principles like unbundling and interoperability have been recognized as useful tools to promote competition.</p>

      <p>It is still to be understood whether all these obligations will survive the negotiation phases and will be confirmed in the final act. However, discussions are also starting on how some of these new provisions may be implemented, and how to define the details and the technical standards. The talk will present the current situation and solicit feedback and comments from the community.</p>

      <p>MariaDB allows fine grained control of access over different database objects. Granting access to a very specific resource is easy. A problem comes up when one wants to grant access to a whole database <em>except</em> for a particular resource (table, column, etc.). The only solution thus far is to grant access to each individual resource and omit the ones that must not be accessible. Clearly this is not maintainable, nor practical.</p>

      <p>This is where the DENY command comes in. The gist of the feature: A user will not be able to access denied resources unless the deny is explicitly revoked. MDEV-14443 - Reverse privileges in MariaDB is an ongoing tasks that will implement it. During this talk we will go through use cases, comparison to similar features of other databases well as implementation details of the feature which will (very likely) be part of MariaDB 10.9.</p>

      <p>MariaDB allows fine grained control of access over different database objects. Granting access to a very specific resource is easy. A problem comes up when one wants to grant access to a whole database <em>except</em> for a particular resource (table, column, etc.). The only solution thus far is to grant access to each individual resource and omit the ones that must not be accessible. Clearly this is not maintainable, nor practical.</p>

      <p>This is where the DENY command comes in. The gist of the feature: A user will not be able to access denied resources unless the deny is explicitly revoked. MDEV-14443 - Reverse privileges in MariaDB is an ongoing tasks that will implement it. During this talk we will go through use cases, comparison to similar features of other databases well as implementation details of the feature which will (very likely) be part of MariaDB 10.9.</p>

      <p>Wayland compositors try to make of most of the hardware by displaying directly without any copy pixel buffers coming from clients such as games, browsers and video players. This lowers battery usage, improves latency and leaves the 3D engine free for clients to use. The display engines found in modern GPUs often can support this zero-copy mechanism only if the buffers have been allocated in a special fashion. However, buffers allocated this way won't be optimal for rendering, and only a handful of buffers can be directly displayed.</p>

      <p>As a result, a trade-off between zero-copy display and optimal rendering needs to be made. The compositor is the natural place where a decision can be made, because it has a global view of all apps which need to be presented. Once the compositor has taken a decision, it needs to be communicated to the clients. The brand new linux-dmabuf feedback protocol enables this negotiation between the compositor and the clients.</p>

      <p>If you're up for some window system integration madness, grab some popcorn and come enjoy the show!</p>

      <p>As was announced in December 2021 https://mariadb.org/new-innovation-release-model/, MariaDB Server now has a new release model, with more frequent major releases. MariaDB Server 10.7 is the first release following this model.</p>

      <p>Some of these releases will have 1 year support cycles, while others will be supported long term just like before. In this talk, I will present the pros and cons of this new release model, what it means for the MariaDB Server community, its users and also its developers. This will also give the community a chance to better understand the changes and give us feedback and ultimately ensure MariaDB Server properly serves its purpose of being a true Open Source Database.</p>

      <p>The MariaDB optimizer has its roots in the original MySQL optimizer. Being a long standing project, it has inherited a number of quirks and features that -at the time of coding- made sense. The datasets had different sizes 10-20 years ago and the cost model is not always accurate for current workloads.</p>

      <p>Thus, there is now an ongoing effort to significantly improve the calculations that the MariaDB Optimizer is doing. With the addition of JSON Histograms, the range optimizer is one of the most impacted modules. The end goal of this effort is to provide the user with a better query optimizer, but also put the user in control and allow the user to tweak many more parameters than were previously available. In this talk I will go through the major changes that are upcoming in MariaDB, changes that could impact query performance (for the better) and also raise awareness about which parameters have the highest impact on query optimizer performance.</p>

      <p>Of the three observability data types supported by OpenTelemetry (metrics, logs, and traces) the latter is the one with most potential. Tracing gives users insights into how requests are processed by microservices in a modern, cloud-native architecture.</p>

      <p>Jaeger and Grafana can visualize a single trace, showing how an individual request traversed your entire system. This helps for distributed debugging and analysis, but using traces only this way is limiting.</p>

      <p>In this presentation, I will share our community's ongoing exploration of running modern and "standard" Linux distributions on vintage hardware - AOSC OS/Retro. AOSC OS/Retro, as an official branch of AOSC OS (the modern-device-facing mainline), runs a generally similar feature set - systemd, Glibc/Binutils/GCC/Coreutils/Util-Linux, X.org/Mesa, etc. and shares the same source tree with the latter.</p>

      <p>With over a year of spending our spare time on the project, tweaking features, designing a desktop experience, and optimising compiler flags, we have a usable distribution that could run on systems as slow as a 486SX, and as fast as "modern" Core Duo systems. We also have an active effort to port AOSC OS/Retro across multiple architectures, with the tally currently standing at eight architectures - and counting (alpha, armv4, armv6hf, armv7hf, i486, loongson2f, powerpc, ppc64). We still have a long list of issues to solve, such as login delays and throttled I/O on ISA-based systems. I hope to gather feedback and criticism through this presentation.</p>

      <p>Two designers came together to tackle this under-addressed issue in OSS. In this talk, we'll cover
      - How design principles have shaped our understanding of the technical challenges in implementing accessibility in OSS, such as writing 'alt-text' for scientific diagrams
      - Learn about the real impact our workshops have made in NumPy, JupyterLab and scikit-learn
      - How other OSS projects can host their own accessibility workshops and sprints</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Designers have valuable skills that go beyond the visual arts: the ability to zoom out and see the big picture, finding connections between disparate objects, and creating a pleasant user flow.</p>

      <p>It is exactly these skills that make designers such valuable mediators of accessibility!</p>

      <p>Mediators are required as the needs of accessible technology and OSS can seem at odds:
      - Accessible technology needs to recognize the variety of disabilities, that there are many possible solutions, and to create cohesive alternative experience
      - OSS needs flexibility and variety: it is exactly because individual contributors add different things that it can be difficult to uniformly follow any sort of guidelines for one disability, much less for a variety of disabilities</p>

      <p>This talk will explore how two designers came together to start mediating for more accessible OSS. Hear about our messy beginning trying to decode terms and guidelines, talking to developers of what they need, and finally creating accessibility-focused workshops for NumPy, JupyterLab and scikit-learn that have already made changes to the codebase.</p>

      <p>Designers will leave with an understanding of accessibility, their role in it and actionable steps, such as how to host their own accessibility workshops in their communities.</p>

      <p>Note: While accessibility is a broad term that encompasses accommodating for a variety of disabilities, this talk focuses on making OSS accessible to people with visual disabilities via implementation of 'alt-text' for scientific diagrams.</p>

      the approach to implementing distributed joins in the CrateDB database that

      In the first part of the talk, we will cover the limitations of the nested loop

      algorithm can work in distributed settings by addressing some of its memory

    description: |-
      <p>In relational databases, join operators are usually implemented with nested or block nested loop algorithms. However, in a large-scale distributed scenario, the ability to efficiently query massive amounts of data can be challenging. Traditional approaches in implementations of join operators are no longer enough to achieve the high performance of complex joins in distributed data processing systems. For instance, a nested loop algorithm is relatively simple to implement and could be easily adjusted to execute distributed joins. Unfortunately,  it comes with a high-performance cost that equals quadratic time complexity with respect to the number of rows of the two tables joined.</p>

      <p>This talk will show our approach to implementing distributed equi-join operator in CrateDB that exhibits significant performance improvements compared to the original nested loop algorithm. CrateDB is an open-source, distributed SQL database that runs queries on millions of data records daily. It scales up to hundreds of nodes and PBs of indexed data making the performance of join operators highly important: it is required to have efficient algorithms that can scale with the input size.</p>

      <p>More specifically, we explore the implementation of the distributed block hash join algorithm. First, we address the memory limitations of the basic hash join algorithm with a switch to block-based processing. Block-based processing refers to a procedure of dividing a large dataset up into smaller blocks that can be worked on separately. As those blocks can be distributed across the CrateDB cluster the join can be executed in parallel using multiple nodes for increased performance and load distribution. Second, we illustrate the changes in the single node block hash join algorithm to enable its distributed execution.</p>

      <p>To evaluate the performance of distributed block hash join algorithm, we run CrateDB benchmarks against two algorithms: the original nested loop algorithm and the single node block hash join algorithm. The benchmark consists of queries with join operators and runs on tables of various sizes, up to 50 million rows. The final result illustrates that the distributed block hash join algorithm enables CrateDB to analyze massive amounts of data 23 thousand times faster than the initial nested loop implementation.</p>

      <p>Camera support has traditionally been a pain point when it comes to

      <p>With the increasing maturation of libcamera, a complete user space
      camera stack for Linux devices is now finally available, and Linux
      phones developers can now cooperate on more mature camera solutions
      for their devices.</p>

      fierce competition everything around cameras has usually been quite
      secretive, with vendors implementing rather cumbersome software
      architectures to work around the software licensing requirements which
      would have otherwise required them to open at least part of what they
      consider their secret sauces.</p>

      <p>Vendor's reluctance to discuss and innovate in a common shared space
      and the undeniable deficiencies (or better, the complete lack of
      existence) of anything resembling a camera stack in the Linux
      ecosystem has pushed camera support to a quite uncomfortable position
      when it comes to FOSS-powered mobile devices. Until very recently nothing
      comparable to what could be achieved by a rather cheap Android phone,
      running binary blobs both in user and kernel space, can be easily
      realized by using a fully open infrastructure.</p>

      <p>Three years after starting of the libcamera project,
      its adoption as the default camera stack for the Raspberry Pi
      ecosystem and its increasing permeation in the x86 device space thanks to
      the support of vendors like ChromeOS and a more robust integration in Pipewire,
      it's now time to finally address the camera issue in the FOSS phone space.</p>

      <p>With the recent interest from Librem5 and Pinephone communities in the
      project, this BoF intends to provide a space where phone developers,
      libcamera developers and hopefully vendors can discuss their mutual
      headaches and try to sketch a way forward in order to provide to
      free-software equipped mobile device a camera support that can do more than what
      an Android phone was capable of 10+ years ago.</p>

      it's now time to finally address the camera issue in the FOSS phone space.</p>

      <p>With the recent interest from Librem5 and Pinephone communities in the
      project, this BoF intends to provide a space where phone developers,
      libcamera developers and hopefully vendors can discuss their mutual
      headaches and try to sketch a way forward in order to provide to
      free-software equipped mobile device a camera support that can do more than what
      an Android phone was capable of 10+ years ago.</p>

      <p>Everyday lots of people have to deal with agreements, contracts, budget plans, and other similar documents. In this regard, an ability to automate work with such files seems appealing. With this understanding in mind, ONLYOFFICE has been working on Smart Forms intended for optimization of file creation and collaboration in any document flow.</p>

      <p>In our presentation, we‚Äôll tell you about the newly introduced ONLYOFFICE Forms, new formats (DOCXF and OFORM) built with the purpose of creating standardized document templates and working with them through specifically designed interface elements in ONLYOFFICE Docs.</p>

      <p>xHumanity is a project that started from the idea of identifying the future of digital identities. This concern resonated all over the globe. We thus gathered an international team. Our concern is based on the increased impact social media has on our lives, but also the context of the amplification of disinformation actions.
      We aim to run a foundation focused on providing our audience with a digital platform based on three pillars, which are reputation, reduction of fake news, and privacy. We aim to empower customers by providing them with a better way of living.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Reputation
      Blockchain technology could help all parties involved in any types of transactions. But not alone. To construct a secure and trustable transaction we need to start with valid data. This data in our case will be provided through reputation protocol. Everyone's reputation passport will reduce friction between parties.</p>

      <p>Privacy
      xHumanity enables decentralized identities: self-managed identities hold that individuals should have control over their own personal data and determine how it is shared with others. End-to-end encrypted communication: the difference between xHumanity and the current messaging app landscape is that xHumanity does not require users‚Äô phone numbers to provide access to its services and features.</p>

      <p>Reduction of fake news
      One of our main goals is to reduce and eliminate fake news from the internet space through a few principles from the gaming theory. Peoples‚Äô involvement in the game is essential, as they are the main actors in creating new social rules.</p>

      <p>Hardware and container virtualisations are the fundamental technologies of modern cloud stacks. While these technologies virtualise different layers of software and hardware, they have one common thing: they are quite inefficient in terms of communication between isolated entities. The isolation relies on MMU and involves a privileged intermediary, which leads to heavy transitions or sharing data at the page granularity. The escape from this trap we see in the hardware capabilities introduced in CHERI. The CHERI architecture efficiently combines hardware memory capabilities with conventional MMU architectures. It gives not only safety to memory pointers, but also provides lightweight isolation mechanisms.</p>

      <p>In this talk, I will present Introvisor, a lightweight hypervisor for microservices. It uses CHERI capabilities for isolation and data sharing, does not require software porting thus compatible with existing software, and provides strong security guarantees.</p>

      <p>Please note: the purpose of this talk isn't to be an exploration of some new state-of-the-art way of doing performance optimization or some relatively unknown optimization techniques. This is a general introduction for people hopeing to use Nim for HPC that are coming from Python. Lots of emphasis will be put comparing the two languages.</p>

      <p>Part 1 (2 min) - Introduction to myself. Describing a computationally expensive problem that I have experienced when working with Python.
      - My background is in data science and biology
      - Biologists tend to work with large datasets
      - One common problem we face is preprocessing of large amounts of data. A common technique used here using distance calculations
      - Why I decided to learn a different language
      Part 2 (1 min) - High level introduction to Nim
      - Nim is a statically compiled programming language
      - Etc...
      Part 3 (10 min) - Going through step-by-step on how to write performance optimal code with Nim. Describing common performance pitfalls that Python users may not be aware of.
      - Integer Types
      - Inlining Code

      <p>Please note: the purpose of this talk isn't to be an exploration of some new state-of-the-art way of doing performance optimization or some relatively unknown optimization techniques. This is a general introduction for people hopeing to use Nim for HPC that are coming from Python. Lots of emphasis will be put comparing the two languages.</p>

      <p>Part 1 (2 min) - Introduction to myself. Describing a computationally expensive problem that I have experienced when working with Python.
      - My background is in data science and biology
      - Biologists tend to work with large datasets
      - One common problem we face is preprocessing of large amounts of data. A common technique used here using distance calculations

      <p>Argentina's National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA) conducts research and development for the agricultural sector. Environmental conditions influence agricultural activity; in particular, climatic conditions have a favorable or detrimental effect on production. Thus, it is essential to monitor and analyze the different agro-meteorological variables to describe these conditions and their impact on agricultural and livestock production. With this approach, INTA has an extensive ground network of conventional and automatic weather stations. In addition, there is an information system (http://siga.inta.gob.ar) with predefined queries and visualization on this data for internal and external use. All the information generated by the institution is openly shared under a CC-BY-NC license.
      INTA is a decentralized institution and generates research, analysis, and reports at different scales (national to local).  The processes to perform these tasks use various software tools and different methodologies.  Moreover, these processes are in the computer and the head of the researchers.<br/>
      Developing internal packages or libraries has great potential to promote reproducible analysis frameworks, improve an organization's code quality, enhance knowledge management (Riederer, 2021), standardize and make processes transparent, and open software and data to society.</p>

      <p>The {agromet} package includes a series of functions that can be used regularly for the calculation of agrometeorological indices and statistics. The input meteorological data works under the tidy data philosophy, so the package functions are generic. They can be applied to any tabular dataset regardless of its origin, order, or column names. However, according to INTA's internal requirements, the package also incorporates tools to read data in an INTA format.  This package has implemented functions for calculating indexes and variables of agricultural interest, standardizing how these computations are made.  It also incorporates mapping functions with scale and reports templates.</p>

      <p>The package {siga} downloads and reads data from INTA's Agrometeorological Information and Management System programmatically.</p>

      <p>This talk will discuss the decision process to generate a series of internal packages designed to be used by INTA users but with enough generality to be helpful to a broad community. Their development, current use, and this experience encouraged the generation of similar packages for soil data.</p>

      <p>Bioimage analysis is the process of extracting novel insights from microscopy images of tissues, cells or other biological entities. Many tools, such as ImageJ, QuPath or CellProfiler are heavily used by researchers to quantitatively interpret those complex images. These tools perform tasks such as normalization, image segmentation, image masking or feature extraction. However, these tools are designed for usage on local workstations with a GUI and for the most part only allow vertical scaling to deal with an increase in dataset size. This limited scalability poses a problem as bioimaging datasets keep growing in volume.</p>

      <p>Here, we introduce Scalable Cytometry Image Processing (SCIP). SCIP is an open-source tool that implements single-cell bioimage processing on top of Dask, a framework for distributed computing written in Python. By utilizing Dask to execute all computations, scalability is integral to the software allowing it to be executed on high performance computing clusters. Dask's smart task scheduling ensures computational resources are used efficiently. SCIP also takes advantage of Dask features such as fault tolerance, load balancing or data locality. This allows SCIP to process large datasets more efficiently and more robustly compared to other tools.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>SCIP was written in Python, and all code is freely available. It can run in local (single-node) or distributed mode. In the latter, Dask's components communicate efficiently using the MPI standard. SCIP can be used as a stand-alone command line tool, or integrated into existing Python scripts using the API.</p>

      <p>For a similar setup, SCIP showed a 4-fold decrease in runtime compared to CellProfiler. SCIP needed considerably less manual work to prepare the dataset for processing thanks to more efficient data input. Comparisons were executed on the Flemish Supercomputer Center Tier-1 high performance cluster. We processed two cytometry datasets containing images of human blood cells: an imaging flow cytometry dataset containing 270,000 6-channel images of 90 by 90 pixels, and a confocal microscopy dataset containing 869 5-channel images of 1600 by 900 pixels.</p>

      <p>The imaging flow cytometry dataset is processed by SCIP in 484 seconds using 80 workers running on 3 compute nodes. Each node has 24 cores (Intel Xeon E5-2680v4 @ 2.4GHz) and 120GB of memory, which is divided over the workers.</p>

      <p>The microscopy dataset is processed by SCIP in 2187 seconds using 16 workers running on 1 compute node. This node has 32 cores (Intel Xeon Silver 4110 CPU @ 2.10GHz) and 364GB memory, which is divided over the workers. This workflow also uses a GPU (Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090) for identifying the cells in the microscopy images.</p>

      instructions once and reuse them for multiple projects. It also shows previews

    description: |-
      <p>Open hardware is beginning to mature. International agencies such as the European Commission and UNESCO see open hardware as key to open access, especially for science hardware. Open hardware could help bring an end to the reproducibility crisis where researchers cannot replicate the work of others. However, open hardware has a key hurdle to overcome: documentation.</p>

      <p>Documentation is important for any open project. You can't study and improve something unless it is documented. For hardware the problem is more pronounced, distribution of hardware relies either on people replicating a design themselves, or on a manufacturer producing the design. Without assembly instructions a project can't be used by anyone, for anything but the most simple project, the digital design files are not enough.</p>

      <p>As open hardware matures documentation becomes even more important. Most people don't have the time to build all of the products they use. Even those who care about open hardware want to buy a pre-made product. To manufacture a product the documentation must be far more complete, including enough design rationale that a manufacturer can fix problems, and containing not just assembly steps, but also quality assurance procedures.</p>

      <p>GitBuilding is a tool designed to allow open hardware designers to keep markdown documentation with their hardware designs, such as in a Git repository. Extra syntax has been introduced to semantically link pages together, and to identify when tools and components are used. This allows the automatic creation of Bills of Materials, as well as reuse of specific instructions for multiple variations of the same project.</p>

      <p>GitBuilding was initially designed for the OpenFlexure Microscope (OFM) project. The OFM is an open source laboratory grade motorised microscope that is being trialled for malaria diagnosis in Tanzania. The open project plans to support manufacturers across the world in selling the OFM as an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device. For this to be possible our documentation must be complete enough that manufacturers can verify the microscopes performance and design, and their own manufacturing of it to a standard acceptable to their IVD regulator. GitBuilding must be powerful enough to support this documentation.</p>

      <p>GitBuilding is now needs to generalise. The project needs to be sure it is collecting the correct data for other types of hardware and for other industries. We need to gather input from across the open hardware community, so we know what data needs to be captured, and so where possible this information can be captured exactly one, and used wherever it is needed.</p>

    raw_abstract: "<p>GitBuilding is an Open source program for writing hardware documentation.
      GitBuilding uses your tags and meta-data to automatically generate and insert
      bills of materials into your documentation. It correctly links different steps
      to one another (even when you have multiple variants), allowing you to write
      instructions once and reuse them for multiple projects. It also shows previews
      of 3D files and lets you easily include links to generated zips and other files
      in the correct places. You can output the entire documentation in pure Markdown,
      HTML, or PDF.</p>"
    raw_description: |-
      <p>Open hardware is beginning to mature. International agencies such as the European Commission and UNESCO see open hardware as key to open access, especially for science hardware. Open hardware could help bring an end to the reproducibility crisis where researchers cannot replicate the work of others. However, open hardware has a key hurdle to overcome: documentation.</p>

      <p>Documentation is important for any open project. You can't study and improve something unless it is documented. For hardware the problem is more pronounced, distribution of hardware relies either on people replicating a design themselves, or on a manufacturer producing the design. Without assembly instructions a project can't be used by anyone, for anything but the most simple project, the digital design files are not enough.</p>

      <p>As open hardware matures documentation becomes even more important. Most people don't have the time to build all of the products they use. Even those who care about open hardware want to buy a pre-made product. To manufacture a product the documentation must be far more complete, including enough design rationale that a manufacturer can fix problems, and containing not just assembly steps, but also quality assurance procedures.</p>

      <p>GitBuilding is a tool designed to allow open hardware designers to keep markdown documentation with their hardware designs, such as in a Git repository. Extra syntax has been introduced to semantically link pages together, and to identify when tools and components are used. This allows the automatic creation of Bills of Materials, as well as reuse of specific instructions for multiple variations of the same project.</p>

      <p>GitBuilding was initially designed for the OpenFlexure Microscope (OFM) project. The OFM is an open source laboratory grade motorised microscope that is being trialled for malaria diagnosis in Tanzania. The open project plans to support manufacturers across the world in selling the OFM as an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device. For this to be possible our documentation must be complete enough that manufacturers can verify the microscopes performance and design, and their own manufacturing of it to a standard acceptable to their IVD regulator. GitBuilding must be powerful enough to support this documentation.</p>

      <p>GitBuilding is now needs to generalise. The project needs to be sure it is collecting the correct data for other types of hardware and for other industries. We need to gather input from across the open hardware community, so we know what data needs to be captured, and so where possible this information can be captured exactly one, and used wherever it is needed.</p>

      <p>Enhancing diversity and inclusion in every aspect of technology is an essential conversation everyone should be a part of. In an increasingly interconnected world, we have a shared responsibility to ensure technology is a force that works to benefit everyone, countering structural sources of inequity where needed.</p>

      <p>This session aims to jump start your personal diversity and inclusion journey by explaining the basics in simple terms with relevant examples for technologists. Concepts covered will include unconscious bias, privilege, equity, allyship, covering and microaggressions.</p>

      <p>Large open datasets are increasingly driving scientific inquiry. Free and open source software (FOSS) allows scientists to create open reproducible workflows that others can easily build upon, accelerating scientific discovery. FOSS also opens the door to many scientists, teachers and students, particularly those in underserved communities who may not have resources to pay for licenses. However, while the value of FOSS Python tools is clear, there are numerous challenges that are specific to the scientific ecosystems that must be addressed.</p>

      <p>First, there are numerous tools that have overlapping functionality, varying documentation quality and varying levels of maintenance. These issues are costly for end users given they will either invest time in figuring out which tool is best and how to use it or worse, reinvent their own workflow duplicating existing efforts which contradicts FOSS goals of building shared open tools that support common workflows. Package design, maintenance and community contributions for FOSS is a well known challenge in the Python FOSS landscape. There are multiple ways to package and document Python software. This makes it challenging for new developers to select a package infrastructure. It also makes contributions more complex as potential contributors may not be familiar with the full suite of package infrastructure options. Finally, many scientists who may be interested in contributing, do not have the necessary skills (e.g. git, GitHub, documentation infrastructure) creating a barrier for them to contribute.</p>

      <p>pyOpenSci will build a model for how FOSS communities can address the challenges discussed above through peer review that instills packaging and documentation quality checks and that looks across the broader ecosystem of scientific software to identify redundancy. It will also drive uniform packaging standards through community driven working groups. pyOpenSci will ensure that vetted packages are maintained over time through communication with maintainers and assistance when a maintainer needs to step down. It will also bring a diverse cohort of new contributors to FOSS through training and mentorship. The pyOpenSci badge on an open repo will become a symbol of community vetted tools that will over time address some of the challenges that the scientific FOSS community faces. Come learn about and contribute to what pyOpenSci will build over the next few years.</p>

The formal training curriculum in most, if not all, universities in the global South do not equip students with the knowledge and tools to practice open science in their research or develop open-source tools.
      To work openly, collaboratively, and build a community, there is a need for awareness and training in using and developing open science tools. Through the OpenScienceKE framework, we developed a model to narrow the gap: the sensitize-train-hack-collaborate model. Using the model, we sensitised through seminars, trained on the use of tools through workshops, applied the skills learned in training through hackathons to develop open-source tools collaboratively.

      <p>Intel, AMD, ARM, all have launched their own TEE. Amazon can be added to that list with AWS Nitro, but unlike the others it is not a hardware manufacturer. Instead, it chooses to provides its own abstractions over the platform used. This leads to some interesting characteristics.
      The Enclave Development Platform (EDP) is a TEE platform SDK developed by Fortanix. EDP already targeted the Intel SGX platform. Recently we also support the AWS Nitro platform. In this talk we discuss the AWS Nitro platform in detail and interesting design decisions we made for the EDP platform.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>In the AWS Nitro architecture, the hypervisor plays a key role. Hardware resources (processor cores and memory) are split off of a parent VM and can be repurposed to run the Nitro enclave. This enclave can be viewed as a separate VM with only processor cores and memory. A hard disk drive is not present, nor can it directly access an Ethernet network. All communication needs to take place over VSOCK to the parent VM. An attestation report can be provided by the hypervisor to ensure that the enclave has been build correctly.
      The Enclave Development Platform (EDP) provides a way to easily build Rust applications on top of TEEs. It should be as easy for developers to target TEEs any other modern operating system. Next to Intel SGX, the Nitro platform has been added recently. To target the Nitro platform, EDP reimplements parts of the Rust standard library. It takes care of starting a runner process in the parent VM, forwarding network packets to/from the enclave and providing attestation evidence.</p>

      The Enclave Development Platform (EDP) is a TEE platform SDK developed by Fortanix. EDP already targeted the Intel SGX platform. Recently we also support the AWS Nitro platform. In this talk we discuss the AWS Nitro platform in detail and interesting design decisions we made for the EDP platform.</p>
    raw_description: |-
      <p>In the AWS Nitro architecture, the hypervisor plays a key role. Hardware resources (processor cores and memory) are split off of a parent VM and can be repurposed to run the Nitro enclave. This enclave can be viewed as a separate VM with only processor cores and memory. A hard disk drive is not present, nor can it directly access an Ethernet network. All communication needs to take place over VSOCK to the parent VM. An attestation report can be provided by the hypervisor to ensure that the enclave has been build correctly.
      The Enclave Development Platform (EDP) provides a way to easily build Rust applications on top of TEEs. It should be as easy for developers to target TEEs any other modern operating system. Next to Intel SGX, the Nitro platform has been added recently. To target the Nitro platform, EDP reimplements parts of the Rust standard library. It takes care of starting a runner process in the parent VM, forwarding network packets to/from the enclave and providing attestation evidence.</p>

Even better: using only Python dictionaries and a database connector library (Psycopg2).</p>

      users complete control over their data, and how we overcame them, such as migrating
      from a monolith to services to allow scalability, managing secure service discovery,
      detaching database from the infrastructure, or managing an easy service installation
      without any orchestrator. In January, we have released Carbonio CE (Community
      Edition) source code to show the results of our work. Contributors are welcome!</p>"

Kubernetes holds a promise to enable automation and process improvement directly contributing to a system's reliability. Establishing a declarative API and providing a cheap and disposable environment, Kubernetes makes it easy to create uniform experiments, which may run manually or be exercised multiple times over the development cycle through a CI/CD system. Despite their abundance, existing benchmarks and Chaos engineering tools work in isolation, thus restricting the complexity of testing scenarios we can build.</p>

      <p>This talk will present Frisbee: an automated suite for the unified testing of distributed applications over Kubernetes. Frisbee simplifies a series of time-demanding activities, including the spin-up of the dependency stack required to bring the system into a steady state, the combined execution of workloads and faultloads, and the validation of the system's behavior via test cases. We will demonstrate Frisbee through a series of tests, focusing on uncertainties at the level of application (e.g., dynamically changing request patterns), infrastructure (e.g., crashes, network partitions), and deployment (e.g., saturation points).</p>

      for other paradigms on top of it which allows pods to coordinate on individual
      jobs, setting them up and making them play nice with ML platforms is not straightforward.
      Using Apache Spark and Apache Mahout we can work with matrices of any dimension

      Kubeflow to make our work quickly and easily reproducible. In this talk, we‚Äôll

    raw_abstract: "<p>Working with big data matrices is challenging, Kubernetes allows
      users to elastically scale, but can only have a pod as large as a node, which
      may not be large enough to fit the matrix in memory. While Kubernetes allows
      for other paradigms on top of it which allows pods to coordinate on individual
      jobs, setting them up and making them play nice with ML platforms is not straightforward.
      Using Apache Spark and Apache Mahout we can work with matrices of any dimension
      and distribute them across an unbounded number of pods/nodes, and we can use
      Kubeflow to make our work quickly and easily reproducible. In this talk, we‚Äôll
      discuss how we used Apache Spark and Mahout to denoise DICOM images of lungs
      of COVID patients and published our Pipeline with Kubeflow to make the process
      easily repeatable which could help doctors in more resource limited hospitals,
      as well as other researchers seeking to automate the detection of COVID.</p>"

      <p>PMIx (Process Management Interface exascale) is a de-facto standard providing a very efficient interface to launch and control distributed tasks. It was created for exascale HPC systems, where launching a computational job can involve tens of thousands of nodes and bootstrapping MPI (Message Passing Interface) becomes cumbersome. PMIx reduces launch times in such systems from minutes to a few seconds.</p>

      <p>Even though the lower launch times are less critical in smaller clusters (but always welcome), the high efficiency of PMIx is also desirable at sub-exascale. The low data footprint and data exchange, as well as leveraging fast interconnects is useful on systems with lower-end network fabrics. Moreover, its tight integration with the resource manager is very helpful to minimize idling on clusters with limited resources.</p>

      <p>At VUB (Vrije Universiteit Brussel), we have recently transitioned our tier-2 HPC cluster to Slurm and enabled PMIx in a mixture of TCP and InfiniBand networks. We will share the lessons learned in the process and practical tips to deploy a reliable setup with open source software.</p>

      <p>Time has come to rewrite our system software in Rust and leave the pitfalls of C behind. This also includes basics such as filesystem support.
      I took on the challenge to implement NTFS, the primary filesystem used by Windows, in a Rust crate that is equally usable from the firmware level up to user-mode.</p>

      <p>While Rust has been conquering the system software landscape for the past few years, there are next to no examples for implementing filesystems.
      Likewise, NTFS only has a single major open-source implementation known as ntfs-3g, and it was developed in C over a decade ago.</p>

      <p>This talk will cover my motivation for targeting NTFS and various use cases for such a Rust crate. I will introduce you to the internals of the NTFS filesystem, how they influenced the crate's design, and how Rust's features can be leveraged to create a safe and maintainable implementation. My talk will cover the current implementation, but also the necessary iterations until I got there.
      Finally, we will also deal with the current limitations of the Rust ecosystem and possible future improvements to the crate.</p>

      <p>You will see that Rust has many advantages for implementing filesystems, and I hope to see more such crates in the future.</p>

      <p>Containers have been an effective way to share reproducible environments for services, CI pipelines, or even user applications.</p>

      <p>In the high availability world, orchestration can then be used to run multiple instances of the same service. However, if your goal is to run these containers on your local machines, you would first need to provision them with an operating system capable of connecting to the internet, and then downloading, extracting, and running the containers.

      <p>In order to lower this maintenance cost and improve the reproducibility of the run environment, it would be best if we could drop this Operating System and directly boot the containers you want to run.

      <p>This is with this line of reasoning that we started working on a new project called boot2container which would receive its configuration via the kernel command line and construct a pipeline of containers. Additionally, we added support for volumes, optionally synced with any S3-compatible cloud storages.</p>

      <p>This project was then used in a bare-metal CI, both for the test machines and the gateways connecting them to the outside world. There, boot2container helps to provide the much-needed reproducibility of the test environment while also making it extremely easy to replicate this infrastructure in multiple locations to maximize availability.</p>

      <p>The entity-component-system pattern (ECS) is popular in game development for its ability to model complex dynamic simulations with mechanical sympathy, in an environment where microseconds matter.</p>

      <p>The pattern is focused on run time composition. Entities are mutable sets of component data types, and systems run for entities with specific sets of components. Many ECS frameworks are oriented around components or entities, and systems use run time queries or filters to match their component data requirements against the live state.</p>

      <p>In this talk, a system oriented ECS is presented which removes all run time work for systems by storing execution state in the systems themselves. Changing an entity's components leverages Nim's static typing and powerful AST macros to precalculate affected systems and generate pared down system state changes.</p>

      <p>The result is statically defined and intrinsically optimised to the user's system/component design, allowing efficient embedded event loops through to complex interactive simulations.</p>

      <p>PIRA is a tool to automatically filter and focus Score-P's profiling to relevant program regions.
      This involves both static, i.e., source-code feature, and dynamic, i.e., runtime information, analysis.
      It uses the whole-program call-graph representation MetaCG for its analyses and has been used for automatic (a) hot-spot detection and refinement, (b) scalability analysis, (c) kernel identification, and (d) MPI load-imbalance detection.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we present an overview of MetaCG and PIRA together with its analyses and a focus on the most recent addition of automatic (MPI) load-imbalance detection.
      Our experiments on the SPEC CPU 2006 suite show that PIRA automatically constructs overview measurements with runtime overhead &lt; 10%.
      For the load-imbalance detection, our experiments on MPI-parallel LULESH and the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model~(ISSM) show that PIRA keeps the runtime overhead below 15%, while correctly identifying the existing load imbalances.</p>

      <p>Most Kobo/Tolino readers offer a well marked console port and often a second UART. If they are not water resistant, they offer an internal ¬µSD card slot containing the whole operating system and bootloader so that sounds like an invitation to do something interesting with them besides just reading books. Especially in prolonged outdoor activities, the display and their low power consumption have their merits. Hardware is quite similar, so you also have chances to get a replacement next corner.
      Several devicetrees and also some drivers made their way into mainline linux now, on others upstreaming work is in progress. Support is starting to find its way into mobile linux distributions like postmarketOS and graphics start to work with standard APIs.
      In this talk I talk about my experiences, especially the current state of support in mainline linux, what is missing and what are the challenges. I will also talk about requirements for the graphics userspace and shortly present my favorite use case: displaying maps.</p>

      <p>Lisp, the second-oldest programming language, has led the way in
      advanced programming techniques through decades of variants and
      dialects. This talk will show how Lisp is relevant even in the
      burgeoning field of mobile Linux distributions, covering four distinct
      techniques for writing touch-friendly, responsive GUI applications in
      various Lisp implementations:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Embedding</li>
      <li>Transpilation</li>
      <li>Foreign function interfaces</li>
      <li>Networked microservicing</li>
      </ul>


      <p>With fully open source examples for each of the methods, written in
      Lisp dialects including Clojure, Scheme and Fennel, this talk will
      weigh up the pros and cons of the different techniques with regard to
      reliability, performance and long-term sustainability in the software
      supply chain.</p>

      <p>Finally, the talk will conclude with a proof-of-concept for a
      declarative graphical application with GTK4, showcasing the advanced
      functional programming features offered by Lisp, and demonstrated on a
      physical PinePhone device running PostmarketOS!</p>

      <p><strong>C%</strong> (from "C with mods") is an experimental meta-programming language that aims to make coding in C more efficient and fun!</p>

      <p>Together with <strong>cmod</strong>, the reference pre-processor/code generator (written using <strong>C%</strong> itself), this project enables the C programmer with generic meta-programming constructs such as: parameterized verbatim code snippets, mapping code to static data tables (in TSV or JSON format), multi-pass code evaluation (allowing meta-meta-programming), compile-time command execution (allowing code generation from any other software/language), etc. as well as C-specific constructs such as: function types, named parameters, selection over strings and structs, etc. The <strong>C%</strong> standard library provides additional functionality through convenience snippets.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Some of the things that <strong>C%</strong> aims to make achievable are:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><strong>Reusability</strong>: Avoid code duplication through parameterized verbatim code snippets.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Use the same data at different locations and across compilation units by mapping static data tables.</li>
      <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Achieve common functionality through C idioms standardized in keywords and the <strong>C%</strong> standard library.</li>
      <li><strong>Concision</strong>: Write and work with concise code and leave the gory details to the generated code.</li>
      <li><strong>Expressivity</strong>: Better express the intent of code by avoiding boilerplate noise.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Inspect all the generated code and have it checked by the compiler.</li>
      <li><strong>Abstraction</strong>: Identify similar things in your code and handle them in a uniform manner.</li>
      <li><strong>Extensibility</strong>: Once uniform handling is in place, adding an additional element becomes easier.</li>

      <p>Beyond C meta-programming, <strong>C%</strong>'s generic keywords enable meta-programming in other languages such as Python, Flex/Bison, etc.</p>

      <p>Driven by the immense popularity of asynchronous frameworks, such as FastAPI, asynchronous database support suddenly became a hot topic in the Python community. As talking to your database often forms a significant portion of the input and output of your application, it's important to do that asynchronously as well. With the release of version 1.4, SQLAlchemy added support for Asynchronous I/O for both its core and ORM features. This means that you can now use the popular SQL toolkit for Python in your asynchronous applications.</p>

      <p>In my talk, I will introduce you to the newly added support for asyncio in SQLAlchemy. I will go over how easy it is to set up the new AsyncEngine, point you to some of the differences with synchronous SQLAlchemy, and show you some of the pitfalls to avoid. In addition, I will also show you how you can run your existing synchronous SQLAlchemy code asynchronously to help you transition to a fully asynchronous application. By the end of my talk, you should know enough to start your own asynchronous SQLAlchemy adventure.</p>

      <p>This talk aims at presenting our trials and tribulations as well as our achievements in designing a compliance software project for open source licenses.</p>

      <p><em>"Are all module licenses in our software project compliant with each other ?"</em>
      Many of our customers have asked us this question even though they already had a plethora of software solutions (not always FOSS software) dealing with this topic.
      This surprised us, and led us to seek out the cause of their uncertainty. We then discovered that many solutions only look for potential risks and provide reports both too detailed, from the legal POV, for practical use by an engineer, and too technical for practical use by a lawyer.</p>

      <p>As engineers are bound to do, we thought there might be a technical solution to this and launched a project.
      As engineers launching a project are bound to do, we encountered a few hitches and made some discoveries along the way.</p>

      <p>Today, here we are to show off the problems we encountered and how we overpassed them, but also to mention that we are open to your contributions (on technical matter or just for suggestions).</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The features of the project are mainly conditioned by our clients:
       - the ability to process a variety of unstructured inputs (zip archives containing code, github or gitlab, dependency manager package lists, and various hypertext links to libraries) ;
       - the requirement of preserving corporate code confidentiality whether in SaaS or on-premise ;
       - outputting a very structured and human-readable report listing actual non-compliances and potential ways to solve these non-compliances ;
       - designing the strategy for integrating our open source software compliance project with CI/CD processes ;
       - and for the non-client-conditioned feature : our product owner decreed that there could be no false negatives in non-compliance detection.</p>

      <p>After a first PoC based on pre-existing code analysis tools (oss review toolkit, licensee, scancode...), we understood that some roadblocks would remain if no improvements were made.
      It is not about reinventing the wheel, but moving from wood to rubber.
      So we made a new PoC including Machine Learning and the results are much more promising. We will release it very soon under AGPL v3 license.</p>

      the past year to bringing the component-based Genode OS to the Pinephone. The
      talk presents my experience story, touching on the hardware, booting, the porting
      of the kernel, component-architecture concerns, and device drivers.</p>"
    description: |-
      <p>Smartphones have become a commodity almost everyone relies on. With the convenience, however, comes complexity that is impossible to comprehend and constantly changing. The opaqueness of hardware and software puts the user in a subordinate position, making their devices - and by extension many aspects of their life - dependent on the decisions of a few dominant corporations. Our personal devices are constantly changing under our fingertips. Steady updates are presumably needed to stay secure, similar to how medicine is needed to stay healthy. But are the incentives of the platform providers aligned with my interests?</p>

      <p>I want my digital life healthy without a constant supply of medicine! To reinforce trust, both hardware and software must become transparent, traceable, and tractable. The Pinephone satisfies the urge for transparency of the hardware, thanks to publicly available schematics and documentation. However, the predominant software stacks - even though based on the open-source Linux kernel - are practically inscrutable because of their immense complexity. Genode's rigid component architecture promises to bring order and clarity - and thereby trustworthiness - to the software.</p>

      <p>Over the course of the past year, I pursued the combination of Genode with the Pinephone, diving deep into the Pinephone schematics, the SoC, booting, Genode's kernel, and device drivers.

    raw_abstract: "<p>Driven by the vision of a truly trustworthy smartphone, I dedicated
      the past year to bringing the component-based Genode OS to the Pinephone. The
      talk presents my experience story, touching on the hardware, booting, the porting
      of the kernel, component-architecture concerns, and device drivers.</p>"
    raw_description: |-
      <p>Smartphones have become a commodity almost everyone relies on. With the convenience, however, comes complexity that is impossible to comprehend and constantly changing. The opaqueness of hardware and software puts the user in a subordinate position, making their devices - and by extension many aspects of their life - dependent on the decisions of a few dominant corporations. Our personal devices are constantly changing under our fingertips. Steady updates are presumably needed to stay secure, similar to how medicine is needed to stay healthy. But are the incentives of the platform providers aligned with my interests?</p>

      <p>I want my digital life healthy without a constant supply of medicine! To reinforce trust, both hardware and software must become transparent, traceable, and tractable. The Pinephone satisfies the urge for transparency of the hardware, thanks to publicly available schematics and documentation. However, the predominant software stacks - even though based on the open-source Linux kernel - are practically inscrutable because of their immense complexity. Genode's rigid component architecture promises to bring order and clarity - and thereby trustworthiness - to the software.</p>

      <p>Over the course of the past year, I pursued the combination of Genode with the Pinephone, diving deep into the Pinephone schematics, the SoC, booting, Genode's kernel, and device drivers. In my talk, I present the experiences made, touch on the use of Linux drivers directly on Genode, and draft a plan forward. The talk will be garnished by a demonstration.</p>

      <p>Let's look at a few 'tricks' with unicode that can make a program look like it's doing (or not doing, for that matter) something it doesn't. Based on the findings in a recent publication, these are well worth being aware of; both from a security point of view and for simply being on your guard against friends who may be trying to pull a prank on you :-D.</p>

      <p>These tricks are well suited for trojan attacks as it can be difficult to detect even with a manual code review thanks to aspects of unicode like bidirectional (bidi) control characters.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The talk is based on some of the possibilites described in the paper "Trojan Source: Invisible vulnerabilities" by Nicholas Boucher and Ross Anderson of University of Cambridge. The implications of this work with regard to Python has been outlined in PEP 672.</p>

      <p>Examples of using/abusing unicode inlude:
       - Look-alike characters (homoglyphs) being used to make two different functions and make calls of one function look like that of the other (eg: Cyrillic –µ and Latin e are too similar for us to distinguish easily).
       - Use bidi control characters to make a part of the appear to be present when it's actually part of a comment.
       - Classic trick of naming files so that even an .exe file can look like a .pdf.
       - Use of invisible characters to make strings that look same when they aren't.</p>

    description: |-
      <p>The size matters when it comes to containers: they should be small but performant. BellSoft engineers came up with the solution and integrated the Alpine musl port into JDK 16. We made containers based on Alpine Linux and immediately understood that we hit the spot. These containers are still in demand and keep gaining popularity.
      Alpine Linux is based on musl. There is usually no difference in performance, but in some cases, musl is less efficient than glibc. The problem is that any Linux distro is made for general purposes, and Linux engineers don‚Äôt have Java in mind when developing them.
      In addition, LTS support for Linux kernel and OpenJDK is longer than that for Alpine Linux, which leads to a more frequent migration between OS versions within one Java release.
      We want to make sure that Java LTS visions are stable within the environments we offer. This is why we created our own distribution, Alpaca Linux, based on Alpine.
      Alpaca Linux has a longer support cycle and includes musl-perf and other components to boost the performance of apps, including Java-based ones.
      In my talk, I will describe the differences between Alpaca and Alpine and show the results of the benchmarks. I will also tell you about the Alpaca release cycle and how to get hands on with this new Linux distro. You will find out how to boost the performance and security of Java deployment with Alpaca Linux. All in all, I think that this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship between Alpaca and Java.</p>

      the programmer's comfort, like for example user-defined literals and container
      aggregates, that allow natural initialization of user-defined containers with
      the same expressions used for basic arrays since the beginnings of Ada. In this

      type for heterogeneous values (a-la JSON) without the need of crutch functions
      (like the usual "+"). Such an structure could be used for compiled-in definitions
      but, more ambitiously, a relatively simple parser for a strict subset of Ada
      could leverage this data structure for natural-looking (to the Ada programmer)
      configuration files. Such configuration files could be useful for tools that
      are strictly Ada-oriented, written by and for Ada programmers.</p>

      <p>At European Organization for Nuclear Research(CERN), for the alignment of large superconducting magnets and cryogenics, an interferometry based system is being devised to identify the position of their elements.
      This technique uses interferometry principle and uses sweeping laser to identify the distance of multiple points using Fourier Analysis. The data acquired from photo-detection module, received after a sweep of laser source, needs to undergo sophisticated post processing to obtain the final results. The system must monitor position of a large number of elements every second. Dealing with 1000s of target points in less than 1 second required time-optimized and precise calculation. Thus, GPU was employed to provide faster and precise results. This required to use signal processing algorithms like: Butterworth Filter, Hilbert Transform, Savitzky-Golay smoothing Filter in GPU.
      This talk will cover steps involved in adopting signal processing algorithm to GPU to achieve better performance and understand the effects of parallelism achieved. For the initial development, CuPy library for NVIDIA GPUs is used and later moved to implementation in C. CuPy provides wrapper for most of the CUDA toolkit in Python. We will also provide highlight about performance metrics with respect to increase in the data size and possible optimizations of its processing.</p>

      <p>In the scope of the National Research Data Infrastructure Germany (NFDI) we develop and maintain a knowledge-base with guides and best practices about scientific software development ‚Äì availabe at https://nfdi4ing.pages.rwth-aachen.de/knowledge-base/.</p>

      <p>With the knowledge-base we pursue the goal to make sustainable software development possible for everybody. Most importantly, we want to encourage people without strong computer science background to apply fundamental best practices, e.g., version control, from the start. We believe this is necessary since many engineers ‚Äì and not computer scientists ‚Äì write scientific code. Starting from version control, the topics range to fully automated experiments using CI/CD workflows. Many of the existing examples concern OpenFOAM development due to the knowledge-base‚Äôs heritage in TU Darmstadt‚Äôs CRC 1194. Since then, we also are working with the Lehrstuhl f√ºr Hydromechanik und Hydrosystemmodellierung (LH¬≤) as well as with the Institute of Wasserbau and the Institute of Fluidsystemtechnik at TU Darmstadt.</p>

      <p>While curating the content, which we maintain in a Gitlab repository using the HUGO website generator, we realized that one of the most important additions that we provide is an actively maintained and simple glossary. Especially for people not yet very familiar with the technologies used, the pure number of terms can be intimidating and confusing. Our glossary helps by providing brief explanations of relevant terms used throughout the articles. An addition for which we modified the actual HUGO template is that we provide a taxonomy of articles rather than a pure folder structure to ease the navigation.</p>

      <p>The knowledge-base is an on-going effort in which we appreciate feedback and contributions. In the presentation, we will take a closer look on the different materials provided for people developing software, people using software, and how people can actively contribute to the knowledge base through our peer-review process and material creation.</p>

    abstract: "<p>In 2017, Italy launched a key initiative to improve public services
      by opening up the development of a handful of core technologies and allowing
      an open governance community to gather around public code. The effort resulted

      started a virtuous ecosystem involving administrations, businesses, and enthusiasts

      internationally at FOSDEM 2018, with the help of the Free Software community.

      <p>Initially, the Internet imitated the institutions of the social world despite their limited eligibility (such as "emails" with their complex and vulnerable architecture). Today, societies are socio-technical without delimitable transitions between technology/Internet and society. Societies have started to adapt to and integrate the possibilities the code provides, no longer vice versa. Sovereign state systems early found their limitations in tackling the resulting challenges. However, software development had already to manage comparable issues. The Java Virtual Machine and Ceph are two of many examples: another abstraction layer can create flexibility, simplification and unification on top of different systems.</p>

      <p>International arbitration could offer Open Source a transnational and globally-unified framework, enshrined in an arbitration agreement: embedded in a dedicated organization in an eligible legal system to facilitate the conduct of organizations and communities on which code and the Internet depend.</p>

      <p>Open source and its related institutions are already the core element of a transnational separation of powers, which is based upon competition: public processes &amp; public code in conjunction with distribution (of development, code, review &amp; testing) enable forking (to avoid monopolies and irrevocable consolidation of powers at one place). Reflecting the software engineering concept "secure by design", Open Source has created a "socio-technical system secure by design" because it avoids single points of failure both in social and technical realms: it does not relate governance to centralization but to distribution. Indeed, if issues like the 2020 Solarwinds Hack would spread in deployed Linux kernels, this could have unprecedented consequences far beyond the technical realms. However, Open Source and its institutions remain capable of providing sufficient security and deterrence. There is much more behind Open Source than just open/public code.</p>

      <p>The increasing use and consolidation of IT in governments may break the traditional separations of powers and does not provide the "security by design" of Open Source institutions if applied to socio-technical systems. Indeed, if one administrator and his password in one consolidated IT department can manipulate the databases used in executive, legislative and judiciary operations, new risks can arise. The system around Open Source already contributes to the security provision of and on the Internet and thus, indirectly to the overall security provision of people and entities that depend on the Internet: it facilitates security in socio-technical societies.</p>

      <p>If it proves eligible, enshrining the relevant (and legally implementable) Open Source institutions in an arbitration agreement may result in an compatible abstraction layer on top of the traditional state systems. Complementary, this abstraction layer may facilitate to release traditional systems from tackling issues they simply cannot tackle without softening and blurring their own institutional architecture. It may turn antagonism into symbiosis.</p>

      <p>However, Facebook's Libra indicates the complexity (but also the possibility) of creating such "implicit legal" ventures (in Switzerland). It also indicates that Switzerland could possibly enable the fusion of an international arbitration body (through its "international private law") with an open/public/distributed but regulable cryptocurrency to facilitate not just the (Open) Source but also (open) exchange within one globally unified system.</p>

      <p>Although they will be critical and challenging for any international arbitration approach, legal patent- and license-related questions are not considered in this lecture.</p>

      <p>This lecture is derived from the perspective of the field of international relations. It illustrates the role of Open Source in contemporary security provisions (next to and in interaction with sovereign states' security provisions for citizens) and it aims to put alternative (types of) approaches with and around Open Source into discussion.</p>

It illustrates the role of Open Source in contemporary security provisions (next to and in interaction with sovereign states' security provisions for citizens) and it aims to put alternative (types of) approaches with and around Open Source into discussion.</p>

      <p>QEmu is a great project but it isn't really designed around high performance gaming.
      Let's create a new project that is specifically designed for running x86 and x86-64 games on AArch64.
      With FEX-Emu now off the ground let's talk about the problems of translating x86 and x86-64 to AArch64. Translating 32-bit games to a 64-bit process encounter a bunch of fun issues. On top of that, translating x86/x64 to Arm has issues that you wouldn't really expect.
      Come along for the ride with all the problems we encountered and where our future plans lie with FEX-Emu.</p>

      <p>The objective is to demonstrate the making of Ada software
      available to Python and Julia programmers using GPRbuild.
      GPRbuild is the project manager of the GNAT toolchain.
      This talk will first present a self-contained small example
      to illustrate the making of shared object files from Ada software,
      so the software can be used in Python and Julia.
      The second part of the talk concerns the application to PHCpack,
      a free and open source software package to solve polynomial systems
      by homotopy continuation methods, written mainly in Ada, and
      available at github at https://github.com/janverschelde/PHCpack.</p>

      <p>The ever-continuing push for digitalisation has increased our reliance on trust services of various kinds, filling various needs relating to document signing, code signing, authorization tokens, and so forth.
      Many of these trust services rely on public-key infrastructure (PKI) and X.509 certificates.</p>

      <p>The sensitive nature of these tools makes them difficult to use in a testing environment. On the one hand, exposing access to production keys in your CI is obviously a terrible idea. But on the other hand, setting up and maintaining a fully functional "mock" PKI environment is also pretty tricky. What can you do about that?</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Using PKI tools in test workflows involves many challenges. Here are a few examples:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>Even a (supposedly) basic task like validating an X.509 certificate involves quite a bit of complexity. Apart from "local" validation logic, you might also have to check the revocation status of your certificate, which could entail talking to an OCSP responder service or looking up a CRL.</p></li>
      <li><p>If you're using secure timestamps (RFC 3161) in your code, your tests might also require access to a time stamping service.</p></li>
      <li><p>Maybe you're using a remote signing service vendor that doesn't offer any sort of "sandbox" for testing purposes.</p></li>
      </ul>


      <p>In all of these scenarios, both test data generation and mock service integration can be quite cumbersome.
      Both in my own time and on the job, I write a lot of code that relates to digital signing in various ways, and this is a kind of problem that I run into all the time. After trying out a variety of methods, I grew dissatisfied with the "traditional" options, and rolled my own PKI testing framework: <a href="https://github.com/MatthiasValvekens/certomancer">Certomancer</a>.
      Certomancer helps with both test data generation, performs trust service mocking, comes with a plugin API, and most importantly, it's FOSS (MIT licence).</p>

      <p>In my talk, I'll take you through some of the "how"s and "why"s of Certomancer's feature set, and talk about some of the mileage that I've gotten out of it.</p>

      <p>Unikraft, and similar unikernels, offer isolation by running a single application inside a separated virtual machine. As such, extracting information from the machine can prove difficult. Moreover, because Unikraft offers support for running a single process at a time, alternate solutions had to be found for exporting data. Prometheus is a common tool used to collect and visualize data that offers decoupling from the observed system, as such, we saw it as a prime candidate for exporting information.</p>

      <p>Our solution was to port a Prometheus exporter inside Unikraft as a separate library and run it on a separate thread. Information from the unikernel is extracted by Prometheus through an intermediary library, named ukstore, that behaves like a simplified ProcFS. ukstore offers an easy method for accessing information and metrics from the system. Using Prometheus with Unikraft, we are thus able to extract performance metrics from highly-specialized virtual machines, store them in a time series database and display them using plots.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The main interface between configuration and statistics data from Unikraft and applications is ukstore. It is based on ProcFS and offers easy ‚Äúfolder/data‚Äù access. This solves the problem of searching through headers to find functions that offer information. The main advantage of ukstore is that all of its setup is done at build-time so there is no impact on the boot-time. Furthermore, it has flexibility, by offering the possibility to create both static entries (created at build-time) and dynamic entries (created at run-time).</p>

      <p>Metrics inside Unikraft are provided by the libraries that generate them. As such, every library can contain functions that offer usage data. At the moment, work was done to offer metrics related to memory, networking, and thread-locking, with metrics related to file systems and the CPU underway. The end goal is to cover as much of the known metrics from Linux, offered through ProcFS, and expose them through ukstore.</p>

      <p>Porting a Prometheus exporter came with the challenge of finding one with the least amount of dependencies, whilst still retaining the usual format. We chose an exporter and adapted it through patches to successfully interact with Unikraft and exposed available performance metrics through it. With all the above puzzle pieces put together, Unikraft instances can be monitored reliably with a minimal impact on the performance of the instances themselves.</p>

      <p>The history of calculation, information processing and computation is very rich. It is driving the industrial revolution and digital transformation of our world. This history is composed of many events related to conceptual and technological breakthroughs. In order to help in the analysis (by researchers) and explanation (to citizens), the NAM-IP Computer Museum is actively developing the "Trajectware" Open Source framework based on a the structuration of illustrated events in the form of timeline fragments that can be explored using various navigation operations to focus on specific periods, aspects (technological, conceptual, cultural, contextual,...) or the involved people/organisations.</p>

      <p>This talk is intended to everyone. It will first present the global design based on (1) a knowledge base back-end inspired by different ontology standards (SEM, DOLCE/Spatial History Ontology, Constructed Past Theory, DBPedia) and accessed through queries and/or a specific API to extract a relevant timeline, and (2) a navigation front-end, currently based on ReactNative. Different timeline navigation features will be illustrated on a concrete application case: the "micro-computer, meg@ revolution" exhibition of the NAM-IP museum.</p>

      <p>Through our presentation, we hope to trigger interesting discussion about our current work and to gather suggestions and interests to grow this project !</p>

      <p>In order to achieve this, we use a mixture of builders, varying from Docker latent workers, to LibVirt workers but also the classical ‚Äúalways on‚Äù buildbot workers. For easier management, we have a separate master process that deals with each type of worker. In this talk, I will talk about our design decisions and some limitations that stand behind these. For example, the testing phase of the MariaDB server generates a very high amount of logs. Since Buildbot can deal with around 10k lines of logs per second, having multiple builds that run at the same time may saturate the master process. In order to deal with this, we use a master locking mechanism together with a multi-master setup.</p>

    description: |-
      <p>The Linux Foundation's Kernel CI project has been aggregating CI system results in KCIDB for a while. We have six systems contributing and have started sending result notifications to maintainers.</p>

      <p>However, as a kernel maintainer or developer, the last thing you want is someone else's issue attributed to your patches. With 10K build and 100K test results daily, it's a given that tested revisions are often red with known issues, despite submitting CI systems masking them independently.</p>

      <p>We're trying to come up with a way to aggregate known issues, similarly to test results, and to prevent misattribution of problems to innocent changes for results coming from all CI systems, equally. We want to give maintainers, test authors, and CI system operators the ability to submit their issue descriptions, manually or automatically, so that we can deal with them, and all can save their time and effort.</p>

      <p>The Linux Foundation's Kernel CI project has been aggregating CI system results in KCIDB for a while. We have six systems contributing and have started sending result notifications to maintainers.</p>

      <p>However, as a kernel maintainer or developer, the last thing you want is someone else's issue attributed to your patches. With 10K build and 100K test results daily, it's a given that tested revisions are often red with known issues, despite submitting CI systems masking them independently.</p>

      <p>We're trying to come up with a way to aggregate known issues, similarly to test results, and to prevent misattribution of problems to innocent changes for results coming from all CI systems, equally. We want to give maintainers, test authors, and CI system operators the ability to submit their issue descriptions, manually or automatically, so that we can deal with them, and all can save their time and effort.</p>

      <p>Fuzion is a modern general purpose programming language that unifies concepts
      found in structured, functional and object-oriented programming languages into
      the concept of a Fuzion feature.  It combines a powerful syntax and safety
      features based on the design-by-contract principle with a simple intermediate
      representation that enables powerful optimizing compilers and static analysis
      tools to verify correctness aspects.</p>

      <p>This talk will explain how Java's concepts such as classes, interfaces, methods,
      constructors, packages, etc. are mapped to the single concept of a Fuzion
      feature.  The fzjava tool will be explained that provides Fuzion interfaces to
      Java libraries.  Finally, the Fuzion interpreter and a (planned) Java byte-code
      back-end are presented.</p>
    description: "<h1>Introduction</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion is a modern general purpose programming
      language that unifies concepts\nfound in structured, functional and object-oriented
      programming languages into\nthe concept of a Fuzion feature.  It combines a
      powerful syntax and safety\nfeatures based on the design-by-contract principle
      with a simple intermediate\nrepresentation that enables powerful optimizing
      compilers and static analysis\ntools to verify correctness aspects.</p>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      was influenced by many other languages including Java, Python, Eiffel,\nRust,
      Go, Lua, Kotlin, C#, F#, Nim, Julia, Clojure, C/C++, and many more.  The\ngoal
      of Fuzion is to define a language that has the expressive power present in\nthese
      languages and allow high-performance implementations and powerful analysis\ntools.
      \ Furthermore, Fuzion addresses requirements for safety-critical\napplications
      by adding support for contracts that enable formal specification and\nenable
      detailed control over run-time checks.</p>\n\n<p>Many current programming language
      are getting more and more overloaded with new\nconcepts and syntax to solve
      particular development or performance issues.\nLanguages like Java/C# provide
      classes, interfaces, methods, packages, anonymous\ninner classes, local variables,
      fields, closures, etc.  And these languages are\ncurrently further extended
      by the introductions of records/structs, value types,\netc.  The possibility
      of nesting these different concepts results in\ncomplexity for the developer
      and the tools (compilers, VMs) that process and\nexecute the code.</p>\n\n<p>For
      example, the possibility to access a local variable as part of the closure\nof
      a lambda expression may result in the compiler allocating heap space to hold\nthe
      contents of that local variable.  Hence, the developer has lost control over\nthe
      allocation decisions made by the compiler.</p>\n\n<p>In Fuzion, the concepts
      of classes, interfaces, methods, packages, fields and\nlocal variables are unified
      in the concept of a Fuzion feature. The decision\nwhere to allocate the memory
      associated with a feature (on the heap, the stack\nor in a register) is left
      to the compiler just as well as the decision if\ndynamic type information is
      needed.  The developer is left with the single\nconcept of a feature, the language
      implementation takes care of all the rest.</p>\n\n<h1>Fuzion Feature Declarations</h1>\n\n<p>A
      Fuzion feature has a name, similar to the name of a class or a function.\nThe
      main operation that can be performed on a feature is a feature call.  The\nconstituents
      of a feature declaration are as follows:</p>\n\n<h2>Formal Arguments</h2>\n\n<p>Features
      may have a list of formal arguments, which are themselves features\nimplemented
      as fields.  On a call to a feature with formal arguments, actual\narguments
      have to be provided to the call, unless the list of formal arguments\nis empty.</p>\n\n<h2>Feature
      Result</h2>\n\n<p>The result of a feature call is an instance of the feature.
      \ Alternatively, a\nfeature may declare a different result type, then it must
      return a value of that\ntype on a call.</p>\n\n<h2>Closures</h2>\n\n<p>Features
      are nested, i.e., every feature is declared within the context of an\nouter
      feature.  The only exception is the universe, which is the outermost\nfeature
      in Fuzion.  A feature can access features declared in its\nouter feature or,
      recursively, any outer feature of these outer features.  This\nmeans, a feature
      declaration also defines a closure of the feature and its\ncontext.</p>\n\n<p>When
      calling a feature <em>f1</em> declared as an inner feature of <em>f2</em>, the
      call must\ninclude a target value which is the result of a call to <em>f2</em>,
      e.g., <em>f2.f1</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Generics</h2>\n\n<p>Features may have generic
      type parameters. E.g. a feature declaration may leave\nthe actual type used
      within that feature open and to be defined by the user of\nthe feature.</p>\n\n<p>The
      list of generic type parameters may be open, i.e., the number of actual\ngeneric
      type parameters is not fixed at feature declaration.  This turns out to\nbe
      useful in the declaration of choice types and functions as explained below.</p>\n\n<h2>Inheritance</h2>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      features can inherit from one or several other features.  When inheriting\nfrom
      an existing features, all inner features of the parent automatically become\ninner
      features of the heir feature.  It is possible to redefine inherited\nfeatures.
      \ In particular, when inheriting from a feature with abstract inner\nfeatures,
      one can implement the inherited abstract features.</p>\n\n<p>A redefinition
      of an inherited feature may implement an inherited feature as a\nroutine or
      as a field.  An inherited feature that is implemented as a field,\nhowever,
      cannot be redefined as something else since fields might be mutable.</p>\n\n<p>Inheritance
      may result in conflicts. An example would be two features with the\nsame name
      that are inherited from two different parents.  In this case, the heir\nmust
      resolve the conflict either by redefining the inherited features and\nproviding
      a new implementation or by renaming the inherited features resulting\nin two
      inner features in the heir feature.</p>\n\n<p>Inheritance and redefinition in
      Fuzion does not require dynamic binding.  By\ndefault, the types defined by
      features are value types and no run-time overhead\nfor dynamic binding is imposed
      by inheritance.</p>\n\n<h2>A Contract</h2>\n\n<p>A feature may declare a contract
      that specifies what the features does and under\nwhich conditions the feature
      may be called.</p>\n\n<h2>An implementation</h2>\n\n<p>Features must have one
      of the following implementations</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>a routine is a feature
      implementation with code that is executed on a call</p></li>\n<li><p>a field
      is a memory slot that stores a value and whose contents are returned on a call</p></li>\n<li><p>an
      abstract feature has no implementation and cannot be called directly, but can
      be implemented by heir features</p></li>\n<li><p>an intrinsic feature is a low-level
      feature implemented by the compiler or\nrun-time system, e.g., the infix + operator
      to add two 32-bit integer values\nmay be an intrinsic operation.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>A
      feature implemented as a routine can contain inner feature declarations.</p>\n\n<h1>Feature
      examples</h1>\n\n<p>Here is an example that declares a feature <em>point</em>
      that functions similar to a\nstruct or record in other languages:</p>\n\n<pre><code>point(x,
      y i32) is # empty\np1 := point 3 4\nsay \"p1.x is {p1.x}\"    # will print \"p1.x
      is 3\"\nsay \"p1.y is {p1.y}\"    # will print \"p1.y is 4\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The
      next example shows a feature <em>base</em> that provides an inner feature <em>plus</em>\nthat
      adds its argument to the value passed to the enclosing base:</p>\n\n<pre><code>base(v
      i32) is\n  plus(w i32) =&gt; v + w\n\nb1 := base 30\nb2 := base 100\nsay (b1.plus
      23)    # will print \"53\"\nsay (b2.plus 23)    # will print \"123\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>Fuzion
      FZJava Tool</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion provides a tool <code>fzjava</code> that takes
      a Java module file and converts it\ninto Fuzion features.  In the spirit of
      Fuzion, Java's packages, classes,\ninterfaces, methods, constructors, static
      methods and fields are all converted\ninto Fuzion features.  Java methods that
      may throw an exception are\nconverted into features resulting in a choice type
      that is either the exception\ntype or the result type of that method.</p>\n\n<p>A
      few intrinsic functions in the Java interpreter back-end use Java's reflection\nAPI
      to access the corresponding Java code.</p>\n\n<h2>Basic approach</h2>\n\n<p>The
      FZJava tool converts each Java class into three Fuzion Features.  Say you\nhave
      a Java class as follows</p>\n\n<pre><code>package x.y;\nclass MyClass\n{\n  MyClass(String
      arg)\n  {\n   ...\n  }\n  void myMethod()\n  {\n  }\n  void myStaticMethod()\n
      \ {\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will be converted into a Fuzion feature
      <code>x.y.MyClass</code> that may not be\ninstantiated directly:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Java.x.y.MyClass(redef
      forbidden void) ref : Java.java.lang.Object(forbidden), fuzion.java.JavaObject(forbidden)
      is\n\n  unit myMethod is\n    ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This feature defines
      a Fuzion type <code>x.y.MyClass</code> and contains wrappers for the\ninstance
      methods.  It is, however, not permitted to directly create instances of\nthis
      feature, which is ensured the forbidden parameter of type void (which\nmakes
      this feature 'absurd', it cannot be called directly since void values\ncannot
      be created).</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, a Fuzion feature containing features for
      static methods and\nconstructors is generated as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Java.x.y.MyClass_static
      is\n\n  new(arg string) is\n    ...\n\n  myStaticMethod is\n    ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This
      Feature defines a unit type.  Finally, a Fuzion feature returning an\ninstance
      of this unit type is generated for convenience</p>\n\n<pre><code>Java.x.y.MyClass
      =&gt; x.y.MayClass_static\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With this, the following code
      can be used to create an instance of <code>MyClass</code>\nwithin Fuzion and
      call <code>myMethod</code> and <code>myStaticMethod</code> of this class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>o
      := Java.x.y.MyClass.new \"test\"\no.myMethod\nJava.x.y.MyClass.myStaticMethod\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The
      counterpart to <code>import</code> a Java class in Fuzion would be to declare
      a field\nand assign the class' unit type value to it, i.e., the code above could
      be\nsimplified as</p>\n\n<pre><code>MyClass := Java.x.y.MyClass\no := MyClass.new
      \"test\"\no.myMethod\nMyClass.myStaticMethod\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or even</p>\n\n<pre><code>mc
      := Java.x.y.MyClass\no := mc.new \"test\"\no.myMethod\nmc.myStaticMethod\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>using
      <code>mc</code> as an alias of <code>Java.x.y.MyClass</code>.  Note that since
      the value of\nfield <code>mc</code> is a unit type, this assignment or any accesses
      of <code>mc</code> will not\nexecute any code at runtime.</p>\n\n<h2>Small Example</h2>\n\n<p>Here
      is a example how Java code can be used from Fuzion:</p>\n\n<pre><code>javaString
      := java.lang.String.new \"Hello Java \U0001F30D!\"                          #

      Example</h2>\n\n<p>The following code shows how Java APIs can be used to create
      a minimalistic web\nserver in Fuzion.</p>\n\n<pre><code>webserver is\n\n   #

      data)?\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Java methods that may result in an exceptions are
      represented by Fuzion features\nthat result in the type outcome&lt;T> where
      T is the Fuzion type corresponding to\nthe Java result type of the method.  outcome
      is a union type that may be either\nerror, which wraps the Java exception, or
      the actual result type T.</p>\n\n<p>Java methods that result in void are mapped
      to Fuzion features that result in\nunit, or, outcome&lt;unit> in case the method
      has any declared exception.f</p>\n\n<h1>Fuzion Interpreter</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      currently supports two back-ends: An interpreter implemented in Java and\nrunning
      on top of OpenJDK and a C code generator implemented in Java using clang\nto
      create machine code.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the interpreter was to quickly obtain
      a way to execute Fuzion\napplications.  Performance was not the main concern.
      \ The interpreter operates\ndirectly on Fuzion's abstract syntax tree.</p>\n\n<p>For
      better performance, a byte-code back-end is planned that will operate on\nFuzion's
      intermediate code instead.</p>\n\n<h1>Fuzion Byte-Code Back-End</h1>\n\n<p>Similar
      to Fuzion's C back-end, the byte-code back-end is planned to work on top of\nFuzion's
      intermediate code.</p>\n\n<h2>Fuzion intermediate code</h2>\n\n<p>Fuzion uses
      intermediate files during different stages of compilation: module\nfiles that
      contain library code, application files for whole applications and\nFuzion intermediate
      representation files that serve as input to the back ends.</p>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      uses a simple intermediate code to represent pre-compiled modules and\nwhole
      applications. This intermediate code serves as the input for static\nanalysis
      tools, optimizers and for different back-ends that produce executable\napplications.
      \ The goal in the design of the intermediate file format was high\nperformance
      and simplicity for tools using this code.</p>\n\n<p>The intermediate code is
      a binary format containing features and types in a way\nthat may be mapped to
      memory and used directly, so overhead of parsing this\nformat into an in-memory
      representation is avoided.  In particular, if only parts\nof a pre-compiled
      module are used by an application, there is no need to read and\nunpack parts
      of the module intermediate representation that are not used.</p>\n\n<p>For features
      containing code, a very simple stack-based format is used. There\nare currently
      only ten different instructions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>* Unit -- produce a value
      of unit type\n* Current -- produce the current instance as a value\n* Constant
      -- produce a constant value\n* Assign -- perform an assignment to a field\n*
      Call -- perform a call to a given feature\n* Tag -- convert a value into a tagged
      value of a choice type\n* Match -- match a choice type\n* Box -- convert a value
      type to a ref type\n* Unbox -- extract the value from a ref type\n* Pop -- drop
      the top element from the stack\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The intermediate code uses
      indices to refer to features and types within\nintermediate files.  This means
      that lookup is very efficient, but it also means\nthat a change in a library
      module requires recompilation of all dependent\nmodules.  Any incompatibilities
      would be found at compile time instead of\nresulting in something like Java's
      <code>IncompatibleClassChangeError</code> at run-time.</p>\n\n<h2>Instance Implementation</h2>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      instances should be mapped directly to instances of Java classes\ngenerated
      for the corresponding features.  Fuzion fields should be mapped to Java\nfields
      and Fuzion routines to Java methods.</p>\n\n<p>Fuzion instances that are accessed
      only locally by their defining features code,\ni.e., they do not live longer
      than their code is executed and they are not\npassed to any other features,
      might be optimized and implemented as Java methods\nusing local variables instead
      of fields.</p>\n\n<h2>Call Implementation</h2>\n\n<p>Fuzion's support multiple
      inheritance similar to Eiffel. Java support multiple\ninheritance only for interfaces,
      so one way to implement dynamic binding in\ncalls would be to define interfaces
      for every Fuzion feature and use the JVM's\ninvokeinterface byte-code for calls.</p>\n\n<p>A
      more flexible alternative might be to use invokedynamic to implement dynamic\ndispatch,
      but this will likely result in higher overhead compared to highly\noptimized
      invokeinterface implementations.</p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion and Next Steps</h1>\n\n<p>The
      Fuzion language definition and implementation are far from stable, but are\ngetting
      closer to become useful.  Big improvements come from the ability to\npre-compile
      modules and from the foreign language interface for Java, which\nmakes a giant
      code base accessible for Fuzion applications to build on.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally,
      new projects such as the language server implementation for Fuzion\nby Michael
      Lill help by integrating Fuzion support in popular IDEs and editors.</p>\n\n<p>Main
      points that are missing right now are</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a powerful standard library</li>\n<li>additional
      library modules for all sorts of application needs</li>\n<li>low-level foreign
      language interface for C</li>\n<li>actual implementations of static analyzers
      and optimizers</li>\n<li>highly optimizing back-ends</li>\n<li>garbage collection
      for the C back-end</li>\n<li>documentation, tutorials</li>\n<li>enthusiastic

      <p>Fuzion is a modern general purpose programming language that unifies concepts
      found in structured, functional and object-oriented programming languages into
      the concept of a Fuzion feature.  It combines a powerful syntax and safety
      features based on the design-by-contract principle with a simple intermediate
      representation that enables powerful optimizing compilers and static analysis
      tools to verify correctness aspects.</p>

      <p>This talk will explain how Java's concepts such as classes, interfaces, methods,
      constructors, packages, etc. are mapped to the single concept of a Fuzion
      feature.  The fzjava tool will be explained that provides Fuzion interfaces to
      Java libraries.  Finally, the Fuzion interpreter and a (planned) Java byte-code
      back-end are presented.</p>
    raw_description: "<h1>Introduction</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion is a modern general purpose
      programming language that unifies concepts\nfound in structured, functional
      and object-oriented programming languages into\nthe concept of a Fuzion feature.
      \ It combines a powerful syntax and safety\nfeatures based on the design-by-contract
      principle with a simple intermediate\nrepresentation that enables powerful optimizing
      compilers and static analysis\ntools to verify correctness aspects.</p>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      was influenced by many other languages including Java, Python, Eiffel,\nRust,
      Go, Lua, Kotlin, C#, F#, Nim, Julia, Clojure, C/C++, and many more.  The\ngoal
      of Fuzion is to define a language that has the expressive power present in\nthese
      languages and allow high-performance implementations and powerful analysis\ntools.
      \ Furthermore, Fuzion addresses requirements for safety-critical\napplications
      by adding support for contracts that enable formal specification and\nenable
      detailed control over run-time checks.</p>\n\n<p>Many current programming language
      are getting more and more overloaded with new\nconcepts and syntax to solve
      particular development or performance issues.\nLanguages like Java/C# provide
      classes, interfaces, methods, packages, anonymous\ninner classes, local variables,
      fields, closures, etc.  And these languages are\ncurrently further extended
      by the introductions of records/structs, value types,\netc.  The possibility
      of nesting these different concepts results in\ncomplexity for the developer
      and the tools (compilers, VMs) that process and\nexecute the code.</p>\n\n<p>For
      example, the possibility to access a local variable as part of the closure\nof
      a lambda expression may result in the compiler allocating heap space to hold\nthe
      contents of that local variable.  Hence, the developer has lost control over\nthe
      allocation decisions made by the compiler.</p>\n\n<p>In Fuzion, the concepts
      of classes, interfaces, methods, packages, fields and\nlocal variables are unified
      in the concept of a Fuzion feature. The decision\nwhere to allocate the memory
      associated with a feature (on the heap, the stack\nor in a register) is left
      to the compiler just as well as the decision if\ndynamic type information is
      needed.  The developer is left with the single\nconcept of a feature, the language
      implementation takes care of all the rest.</p>\n\n<h1>Fuzion Feature Declarations</h1>\n\n<p>A
      Fuzion feature has a name, similar to the name of a class or a function.\nThe
      main operation that can be performed on a feature is a feature call.  The\nconstituents
      of a feature declaration are as follows:</p>\n\n<h2>Formal Arguments</h2>\n\n<p>Features
      may have a list of formal arguments, which are themselves features\nimplemented
      as fields.  On a call to a feature with formal arguments, actual\narguments
      have to be provided to the call, unless the list of formal arguments\nis empty.</p>\n\n<h2>Feature
      Result</h2>\n\n<p>The result of a feature call is an instance of the feature.
      \ Alternatively, a\nfeature may declare a different result type, then it must
      return a value of that\ntype on a call.</p>\n\n<h2>Closures</h2>\n\n<p>Features
      are nested, i.e., every feature is declared within the context of an\nouter
      feature.  The only exception is the universe, which is the outermost\nfeature
      in Fuzion.  A feature can access features declared in its\nouter feature or,
      recursively, any outer feature of these outer features.  This\nmeans, a feature
      declaration also defines a closure of the feature and its\ncontext.</p>\n\n<p>When
      calling a feature <em>f1</em> declared as an inner feature of <em>f2</em>, the
      call must\ninclude a target value which is the result of a call to <em>f2</em>,
      e.g., <em>f2.f1</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Generics</h2>\n\n<p>Features may have generic
      type parameters. E.g. a feature declaration may leave\nthe actual type used
      within that feature open and to be defined by the user of\nthe feature.</p>\n\n<p>The
      list of generic type parameters may be open, i.e., the number of actual\ngeneric
      type parameters is not fixed at feature declaration.  This turns out to\nbe
      useful in the declaration of choice types and functions as explained below.</p>\n\n<h2>Inheritance</h2>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      features can inherit from one or several other features.  When inheriting\nfrom
      an existing features, all inner features of the parent automatically become\ninner
      features of the heir feature.  It is possible to redefine inherited\nfeatures.
      \ In particular, when inheriting from a feature with abstract inner\nfeatures,
      one can implement the inherited abstract features.</p>\n\n<p>A redefinition
      of an inherited feature may implement an inherited feature as a\nroutine or
      as a field.  An inherited feature that is implemented as a field,\nhowever,
      cannot be redefined as something else since fields might be mutable.</p>\n\n<p>Inheritance
      may result in conflicts. An example would be two features with the\nsame name
      that are inherited from two different parents.  In this case, the heir\nmust
      resolve the conflict either by redefining the inherited features and\nproviding
      a new implementation or by renaming the inherited features resulting\nin two
      inner features in the heir feature.</p>\n\n<p>Inheritance and redefinition in
      Fuzion does not require dynamic binding.  By\ndefault, the types defined by
      features are value types and no run-time overhead\nfor dynamic binding is imposed
      by inheritance.</p>\n\n<h2>A Contract</h2>\n\n<p>A feature may declare a contract
      that specifies what the features does and under\nwhich conditions the feature
      may be called.</p>\n\n<h2>An implementation</h2>\n\n<p>Features must have one
      of the following implementations</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>a routine is a feature
      implementation with code that is executed on a call</p></li>\n<li><p>a field
      is a memory slot that stores a value and whose contents are returned on a call</p></li>\n<li><p>an
      abstract feature has no implementation and cannot be called directly, but can
      be implemented by heir features</p></li>\n<li><p>an intrinsic feature is a low-level
      feature implemented by the compiler or\nrun-time system, e.g., the infix + operator
      to add two 32-bit integer values\nmay be an intrinsic operation.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>A
      feature implemented as a routine can contain inner feature declarations.</p>\n\n<h1>Feature
      examples</h1>\n\n<p>Here is an example that declares a feature <em>point</em>
      that functions similar to a\nstruct or record in other languages:</p>\n\n<pre><code>point(x,
      y i32) is # empty\np1 := point 3 4\nsay \"p1.x is {p1.x}\"    # will print \"p1.x
      is 3\"\nsay \"p1.y is {p1.y}\"    # will print \"p1.y is 4\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The
      next example shows a feature <em>base</em> that provides an inner feature <em>plus</em>\nthat
      adds its argument to the value passed to the enclosing base:</p>\n\n<pre><code>base(v
      i32) is\n  plus(w i32) =&gt; v + w\n\nb1 := base 30\nb2 := base 100\nsay (b1.plus
      23)    # will print \"53\"\nsay (b2.plus 23)    # will print \"123\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>Fuzion
      FZJava Tool</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion provides a tool <code>fzjava</code> that takes
      a Java module file and converts it\ninto Fuzion features.  In the spirit of
      Fuzion, Java's packages, classes,\ninterfaces, methods, constructors, static
      methods and fields are all converted\ninto Fuzion features.  Java methods that
      may throw an exception are\nconverted into features resulting in a choice type
      that is either the exception\ntype or the result type of that method.</p>\n\n<p>A
      few intrinsic functions in the Java interpreter back-end use Java's reflection\nAPI
      to access the corresponding Java code.</p>\n\n<h2>Basic approach</h2>\n\n<p>The
      FZJava tool converts each Java class into three Fuzion Features.  Say you\nhave
      a Java class as follows</p>\n\n<pre><code>package x.y;\nclass MyClass\n{\n  MyClass(String
      arg)\n  {\n   ...\n  }\n  void myMethod()\n  {\n  }\n  void myStaticMethod()\n
      \ {\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will be converted into a Fuzion feature
      <code>x.y.MyClass</code> that may not be\ninstantiated directly:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Java.x.y.MyClass(redef
      forbidden void) ref : Java.java.lang.Object(forbidden), fuzion.java.JavaObject(forbidden)
      is\n\n  unit myMethod is\n    ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This feature defines
      a Fuzion type <code>x.y.MyClass</code> and contains wrappers for the\ninstance
      methods.  It is, however, not permitted to directly create instances of\nthis
      feature, which is ensured the forbidden parameter of type void (which\nmakes
      this feature 'absurd', it cannot be called directly since void values\ncannot
      be created).</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, a Fuzion feature containing features for
      static methods and\nconstructors is generated as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Java.x.y.MyClass_static
      is\n\n  new(arg string) is\n    ...\n\n  myStaticMethod is\n    ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This
      Feature defines a unit type.  Finally, a Fuzion feature returning an\ninstance
      of this unit type is generated for convenience</p>\n\n<pre><code>Java.x.y.MyClass
      =&gt; x.y.MayClass_static\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With this, the following code
      can be used to create an instance of <code>MyClass</code>\nwithin Fuzion and
      call <code>myMethod</code> and <code>myStaticMethod</code> of this class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>o
      := Java.x.y.MyClass.new \"test\"\no.myMethod\nJava.x.y.MyClass.myStaticMethod\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The
      counterpart to <code>import</code> a Java class in Fuzion would be to declare
      a field\nand assign the class' unit type value to it, i.e., the code above could
      be\nsimplified as</p>\n\n<pre><code>MyClass := Java.x.y.MyClass\no := MyClass.new
      \"test\"\no.myMethod\nMyClass.myStaticMethod\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or even</p>\n\n<pre><code>mc
      := Java.x.y.MyClass\no := mc.new \"test\"\no.myMethod\nmc.myStaticMethod\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>using
      <code>mc</code> as an alias of <code>Java.x.y.MyClass</code>.  Note that since
      the value of\nfield <code>mc</code> is a unit type, this assignment or any accesses
      of <code>mc</code> will not\nexecute any code at runtime.</p>\n\n<h2>Small Example</h2>\n\n<p>Here
      is a example how Java code can be used from Fuzion:</p>\n\n<pre><code>javaString
      := java.lang.String.new \"Hello Java \U0001F30D!\"                          #
      create Java string, type Java.java.lang.String\njavaBytes  := javaString.getBytes
      \"UTF8\"                                     # get its UTF8 bytes, type is fuzion.java.Array&lt;i8&gt;\nmatch
      javaBytes\n  err error =&gt; say \"got an error: $err\"\n  bytes fuzion.java.Array
      =&gt;\n    say \"string has {bytes.count} bytes: $bytes\"\n    javaString2 :=
      java.lang.String.new bytes 6 bytes.count-6                # create Java string
      from bytes subset,\n    say \"Hello \"+javaString2                                                 #
      append Java string to Fuzion string and print it\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Web Server
      Example</h2>\n\n<p>The following code shows how Java APIs can be used to create
      a minimalistic web\nserver in Fuzion.</p>\n\n<pre><code>webserver is\n\n   #
      declare short hands to access Java net and io packages\n   net := Java.java.net\n
      \  io  := Java.java.io\n\n   # open socket\n   port := 8080\n   serversocket
      := net.ServerSocket.new port\n   match serversocket\n     err error =&gt; say
      \"#### $err ####\"\n     ss Java.java.net.ServerSocket =&gt;\n\n       for n
      in 1.. do\n         say \"accepting connections to localhost:$port\"\n\n         match
      accept\n           unit      =&gt; say \"ok.\"\n           err error =&gt; say
      \"#### $err ####\"\n\n         accept outcome&lt;unit&gt; is\n           # accept

      represented by Fuzion features\nthat result in the type outcome&lt;T> where
      T is the Fuzion type corresponding to\nthe Java result type of the method.  outcome
      is a union type that may be either\nerror, which wraps the Java exception, or
      the actual result type T.</p>\n\n<p>Java methods that result in void are mapped
      to Fuzion features that result in\nunit, or, outcome&lt;unit> in case the method
      has any declared exception.f</p>\n\n<h1>Fuzion Interpreter</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      currently supports two back-ends: An interpreter implemented in Java and\nrunning
      on top of OpenJDK and a C code generator implemented in Java using clang\nto
      create machine code.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the interpreter was to quickly obtain
      a way to execute Fuzion\napplications.  Performance was not the main concern.
      \ The interpreter operates\ndirectly on Fuzion's abstract syntax tree.</p>\n\n<p>For
      better performance, a byte-code back-end is planned that will operate on\nFuzion's
      intermediate code instead.</p>\n\n<h1>Fuzion Byte-Code Back-End</h1>\n\n<p>Similar
      to Fuzion's C back-end, the byte-code back-end is planned to work on top of\nFuzion's
      intermediate code.</p>\n\n<h2>Fuzion intermediate code</h2>\n\n<p>Fuzion uses
      intermediate files during different stages of compilation: module\nfiles that
      contain library code, application files for whole applications and\nFuzion intermediate
      representation files that serve as input to the back ends.</p>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      uses a simple intermediate code to represent pre-compiled modules and\nwhole
      applications. This intermediate code serves as the input for static\nanalysis
      tools, optimizers and for different back-ends that produce executable\napplications.
      \ The goal in the design of the intermediate file format was high\nperformance
      and simplicity for tools using this code.</p>\n\n<p>The intermediate code is
      a binary format containing features and types in a way\nthat may be mapped to
      memory and used directly, so overhead of parsing this\nformat into an in-memory
      representation is avoided.  In particular, if only parts\nof a pre-compiled
      module are used by an application, there is no need to read and\nunpack parts
      of the module intermediate representation that are not used.</p>\n\n<p>For features
      containing code, a very simple stack-based format is used. There\nare currently
      only ten different instructions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>* Unit -- produce a value
      of unit type\n* Current -- produce the current instance as a value\n* Constant
      -- produce a constant value\n* Assign -- perform an assignment to a field\n*
      Call -- perform a call to a given feature\n* Tag -- convert a value into a tagged
      value of a choice type\n* Match -- match a choice type\n* Box -- convert a value
      type to a ref type\n* Unbox -- extract the value from a ref type\n* Pop -- drop
      the top element from the stack\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The intermediate code uses
      indices to refer to features and types within\nintermediate files.  This means
      that lookup is very efficient, but it also means\nthat a change in a library
      module requires recompilation of all dependent\nmodules.  Any incompatibilities
      would be found at compile time instead of\nresulting in something like Java's
      <code>IncompatibleClassChangeError</code> at run-time.</p>\n\n<h2>Instance Implementation</h2>\n\n<p>Fuzion
      instances should be mapped directly to instances of Java classes\ngenerated
      for the corresponding features.  Fuzion fields should be mapped to Java\nfields
      and Fuzion routines to Java methods.</p>\n\n<p>Fuzion instances that are accessed
      only locally by their defining features code,\ni.e., they do not live longer
      than their code is executed and they are not\npassed to any other features,
      might be optimized and implemented as Java methods\nusing local variables instead
      of fields.</p>\n\n<h2>Call Implementation</h2>\n\n<p>Fuzion's support multiple
      inheritance similar to Eiffel. Java support multiple\ninheritance only for interfaces,
      so one way to implement dynamic binding in\ncalls would be to define interfaces
      for every Fuzion feature and use the JVM's\ninvokeinterface byte-code for calls.</p>\n\n<p>A
      more flexible alternative might be to use invokedynamic to implement dynamic\ndispatch,
      but this will likely result in higher overhead compared to highly\noptimized
      invokeinterface implementations.</p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion and Next Steps</h1>\n\n<p>The
      Fuzion language definition and implementation are far from stable, but are\ngetting
      closer to become useful.  Big improvements come from the ability to\npre-compile
      modules and from the foreign language interface for Java, which\nmakes a giant
      code base accessible for Fuzion applications to build on.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally,
      new projects such as the language server implementation for Fuzion\nby Michael
      Lill help by integrating Fuzion support in popular IDEs and editors.</p>\n\n<p>Main
      points that are missing right now are</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a powerful standard library</li>\n<li>additional
      library modules for all sorts of application needs</li>\n<li>low-level foreign
      language interface for C</li>\n<li>actual implementations of static analyzers
      and optimizers</li>\n<li>highly optimizing back-ends</li>\n<li>garbage collection
      for the C back-end</li>\n<li>documentation, tutorials</li>\n<li>enthusiastic
      contributors and users!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Please feel free to contact me in
      case you want to use Fuzion or want to help\nmaking it a success!</p>"

      cost threshold might seem daunting. However, in polypoly we‚Äôve tried to do it

    description: |-
      <p>Testing needs to follow the F.I.R.S.T. principles, of which the first one, Fast, is possibly the most important. Fast testing ensures that developers respond quickly to all kind of testing errors, and of course it keeps the cost of testing low.</p>

      <p>Monorepos have additional challenges: dependencies cross language boundaries, dependence graphs are not explicit, and there's the risk of centralising some, none, or all the submodule upstream dependencies.</p>

      <p>At polypoly we have been using a monorepo since May 2021. In this talk we will show how we have tackled this challenge with a series of GitHub actions, as well as creating a tool, build.js, which is geared towards dealing with monorepos.</p>

      <p>We will show how this tool partially solves the speed issue, and what are our plans, going forward, to make tests faster and deal with implicit dependency graphs. We will also examine best practices in the area of monorepo builds for projects whose majority is written in Javascript/Typescript.</p>

    abstract: <p>"How can we democratize computing?" ‚Äî that is a sentiment echoed
      by many people, especially those of us in tech who realize what the general
      audience is missing out from computing devices, when they use them as passive
      consumers. If we think of computing devices as programmable tools for active
      exploration, how should they look like? What programming model should they be
      based on? It's fair to assume that it shouldn't look like what passes for regular
      programming nowadays, since that is clearly out of touch with users. Perhaps
      something more... declarative? ...minimalistic? So, how can we bring declarative
      and minimalistic computing to the masses? And... maybe we have already?</p>

      <p>I have started to teach OSS licences and compliances at a Japanese university since last year. it was difficult to teach OSS licences and compliances because I should have shown many of use cases so that the students could learn what the licences and compliance are and more, they even didn't know how to deal with ordinal software licenses. So, I had to talk many of the background knowledges to the students as an 'introduction' so that students could understand the OSS licences with compliances with ease. Fortunately, there were good feedbacks from the students, though, I need to improve my lecture more gathering more use cases etc.
      I will give a talk my experiences there at the university and discuss how to improve my lecture to teach such 'licences and compliances' to students. the feedbacks/ideas for my talk are really welcome!</p>

      <p>"Open source is eating the world". The same happens with the automation tools domain, including Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery solutions. There are many open source CI/CD tools or open source ecosystems on the market: Jenkins, Spinnaker, Woodpecker, GitLab, Tekton, BuildBot, etc., etc. Actually, there are many generations of these tools, with their own architectures and use-cases. We will talk about these tools and their evolution. Wide adoption of open source culture now became one of the drivers for the ecosystem.</p>

      <p>What changed since CI was introduced 20 years ago? How do Open Source, InnerSource and DevOps impact the landscape? What's next for the tools: cloud-native environments, machine learning, etc.? And how do open source foundations, including the Continuous Delivery Foundation, participate in the evolution of the open source tools and facilitate it?</p>

      <p>Service-level objectives (SLOs) are a key element of modern software engineering practices. They allow quantifying the quality of the provided service to end users, and hence maintaining them becomes important for modern DevOps approaches with progressive delivery. In this lightning talk we will show how to use Keptn  to leverage your existing monitoring with Prometheus so that you can visualize SLOs to key stakeholders, and can automate acting on them.</p>

      <p>What is Keptn? In a nutshell it‚Äôs an event-driven control plane for orchestration of cloud native applications. It enables many use-cases including but not limited SLO-driven operations, observability, alerting and remediation. It is a sandbox project within the CNCF, and it has applied for incubating status.</p>

      <p>The aim of this abstract is to showcase the enhanced debuggability support added in LLVM for the Fortran language features. LLVM being emerging compiler framework, there was some gap to be bridged w.r.t. Fortran language debug info generation. This is because Fortran language has few features which are very powerful, as compared to other languages.</p>

      <p>Fortran dynamic arrays are one such powerful language feature. There are variety of arrays like adjustable array, assumed shape, assumed size, assumed rank, allocatable and pointer arrays. LLVM generated debug info was not sufficient to debug these many variety of arrays with GDB/LLDB. The LLVM was lacking support for multiple DWARF operators (DW<em>OP</em>push<em>object address, DW</em>OP<em>over), DWARF attributes (DW</em>AT<em>data</em>location, DW<em>AT</em>allocated, DW<em>AT</em>associated, DW<em>AT</em>rank) and a DWARF TAGs (DW<em>TAG</em>generic_subrange). Other than these, existing support for DISubrange was not sufficient to handle Fortran arrays. The same was true for Fortran strings which is not mere pointer to character type and needed more support from LLVM. Other features which needed similar LLVM support for debugging were Fortran modules, namelist and signed constants etc.</p>

      <p>All these enhancements made in LLVM are as per DWARF4 or DWARF5 specification for the Fortran language. These enhanced debug info are used by GDB/LLDB and user debugging experience is improved now while handling these Fortran features with GDB/LLDB. In order to make use of these enhanced debug info emitted by LLVM, GDB/LLDB is also enhanced in cases where required. With these enhancements added now in LLVM, Fortran program debugging experience with the clang/flang emitted programs are on par with gcc/gfortran emitted programs and in some cases it‚Äôs even better than gcc/gfortran.</p>

      <p>Is the Butler Still Young? Maybe not but it is still one of the most popular automation tools. Jenkins in 2022 is not Jenkins in 2012. It keeps evolving to address demands from its users and contributors: pipeline as code, configuration as code, better support for cloud environments, user experience, etc. There are many ongoing initiatives in the Jenkins community, and we are looking forward to the next major iteration in Jenkins evolution. The story for Jenkins is far from being over. So what‚Äôs next for it?</p>

      <p>This session will be my first ever uncensored talk about Jenkins which I consider an automation framework first. I will focus on the current challenges for Jenkins, including but not limited to community stagnation, UI/UX, and adoption challenges in modern cloud native environments? What does need to change in the project and the community to make the project relevant? We will talk about revitalizing the community and attracting new company contributors, consolidating user experiences, and reusing experiences of the BlueOcean and Jenkins X projects? We will also talk about interoperability with other projects, making Tekton a first class citizen Pipeline engine, and making Jenkins available everywhere regardless of CI/CD system you actually use.</p>

      <p>CadQuery is a Python module for building parametric 3D CAD models in boundary representation (B-rep). It has an active community that has created editors, personal projects, research projects, examples for new and advanced users, and plugins that extend the functionality of CadQuery. The project is maintained by a small core team and numerous community members. CadQuery is built on the OpenCASCADE (OCCT) CAD kernel, and has support for 2D and 3D primitives, allows 3D assemblies and 2D sketches to be created with constraints, and makes heavy use of features like selectors to help capture design intent.</p>

      <p>There are multiple editors available for CadQuery including CQ-editor (desktop application), Jupyter-CadQuery (web based), and CadHub (web based CodeCAD sharing platform). There are repositories dedicated to examples and plugins, as well as separate projects for generating sprockets, chains, fasteners, polyhedra, and complex curves. Community members are responsible for much of the content in these repositories. There are also projects that rely on CadQuery, including in fusion research (Paramak), electrical component 3D model generation (KiCAD), and a more mouse-driven CAD application called Semblage. There are several ways of connecting with the community, including Discord, Matrix, Google Group and GitHub. Please introduce yourself and connect with other CadQuery users.</p>

      <p>The Sustaining open source design podcast has been hosting conversations about open source and design over the last year with designers of all kinds across the spectrum of open source software projects. From new to open source to long term contributors and from practicing visual designers to design researchers. We've spent over 30 hours in conversation with designers and we are coming together as hosts to discuss the main themes throughout these conversations in 2021 at FOSDEM 2022 with a look ahead to what might come up in 2022 for design in OSS.</p>

      <p>Faster computations, faster communication speeds, faster everything. Today electronics can use data rates of several gigabits per second. At such speed wires and tracks are far from being perfect, bugs and glitches may arise because of them. Even low-speed designs are not safe and can encounter high-speed problems because they use high-speed capable chips.</p>

      <p>While the electronic CAD software KiCad has the tools to design high-speed boards, there is no tool to validate them. The usual way is to apply all good practice rules, even if they are sometimes overly conservative and might waste some board space. The layout plays an important part in both PCB performance and cost. A PCB simulator, integrated into KiCad, would help designers to find their balance between the two. This presentation is a short introduction to IBIS and FEM, tools that will most certainly be needed for such high-speed simulations, and provides application examples.</p>

Nowadays' Linux enthusiasts appear to be pretty much of the same breed. Fork this project, run that software. On your own infrastucture, no less.</p>

      <p>With 'Do it Yourself!' seemingly written on each and every F(L)OSS project in existence, should one take the hint and roll yet another Linux distribution? What could possibly go wrong?</p>

      <p>As tech lead on commercial UNIX at Bell Labs, an opportunity arose in 1988 to write a nano-kernel to end all nano-kernels, complete with an unhackable boot requirement. It was clear that a cryptographically secure chip level boot assistance was required, which guided subsequent patented ECC work at NeXT and Apple. Post Apple, in a ‚ÄúSocial Purpose‚Äù company of his own, work has continued to fully realize this dream. The 1988 nanokernel had no threads and delivered messages across upcall channels to a thread simulation, yet that was unsatisfactory. The social element of phishing etc. is now the most feared secuirity breach, and in new work, discussed, the complete solution space is described, in the first half. New hardware is underway, solving such issues as weak memory models.</p>

      <p>In the second half of the talk, key lockless queuing primitives are discussed that form the basis fo a multi-core actor runtime (MART) to subsume most if not all duties of the executive. Far richer than a hypervisor, the executive manages memory in new manners, in a memory safe programmer nature. In practice, a single core actor runtime (START), running across 32, 64 arm, x86, and extensa cpu architectures is available. The language and runtime are destined to the Open Source world, unless the larger project, TheDew, makes file systems and databases obsolete in its first rollout, which will include unhackable identity.

      <p>In this lighting talk we want to talk about the potential of open source not only for code, but also for policy documents.</p>

      <p>One of the pillars to promote open government at any level of government is that there should exist an open data policy. However, in the Mexican context, although one already exists at the federal level, very few states and municipalities have open data policies. This is partly due to the lack of knowledge and culture about open government, especially at the municipal level.</p>

      <p>From Codeando M√©xico we work to promote citizen participation and open government, and we have carried out several exercises to co-create open data policies with the three levels of government: federal, state and municipal.</p>

      <p>With this experience, we saw the need for the creation of an open data policy with a free use license. This policy, a work in progress, will be hosted in an open repository, will allow any level of government that wants to have an open data policy to adopt it and adapt it to their needs in a short time.</p>

      <p>This project is nourished not only by the experience of Mexican civil society of the last 10 years but also, being an open source project, it will be in continuous evolution and improvement with the contributions of governments, civil society and any interested citizen.</p>

      <p>At least since the final Multics report in 1977, researchers identified the ability to isolate kernel subsystems as a critical mechanism for increasing the reliability and security of the kernel. Unfortunately, despite many attempts to introduce isolation to the kernel, modern systems remain monolithic. Historically, software and hardware mechanisms introduce a prohibitively high overhead for the isolation of subsystems with the tightest performance budgets. Today, however, the balance of isolation and performance is starting to change with the development of Rust, arguably, the first practical programming language that achieves safety without garbage collection.</p>

      <p>RedLeaf is a new operating system developed from scratch in Rust with the goal to explore the impact of language safety on operating system organization, and specifically on the ability to utilize fine-grained isolation and its benefits in the kernel. In contrast to commodity systems, RedLeaf does not rely on hardware address spaces for isolation and instead uses only type and memory safety of the Rust language. Departure from costly hardware isolation mechanisms allows us to explore the design space of systems that embrace lightweight fine-grained isolation of kernel subsystems. We develop a new abstraction of a language-based isolation domain that implements a unit of information hiding and isolation of faults. Domains can be dynamically loaded and cleanly terminated. Building on  RedLeaf isolation mechanisms, we demonstrate the possibility to implement end-to-end zero-copy, fault isolation, and transparent recovery of device drivers.</p>

      <p>To evaluate the practicality of RedLeaf abstractions, we implemented a subset of the POSIX interface as a collection of RedLeaf domains. RedLeaf's isolation mechanisms allow us to support the transparent recovery of device drivers. To demonstrate that Rust and fine-grained isolation introduce a practically-acceptable overhead, we develop efficient versions of 10Gbps network and PCIe-attached solid state-disk NVMe device drivers that match the performance of carefully-optimized kernel-bypass device drivers used in modern network and storage processing frameworks.</p>

      <p>This talk will go through how we open sourced the documentation for the <a href="https://orbit.kiwi/">Orbit design system</a> and discuss what we learned from the process. It will discuss creating both visual and content standards for the docs and how it was all accomplished. The lessons from this experience can help in the creation of useful and accessible documentation to guide the design process.</p>

      <p>What is new in WebRTC, what can we expect to see in the next couple of years?
      I'll describe some new APIs and speculate on how they might be used.
      I'll introduce whipi (an opensource implementation of the new WebRTC Ingest Protocol) and use it to illustrate how the WebRTC world is changing.
      I'll try to predict some new usages of WebRTC - niche high value apps.
      Finally I'll describe how to create a decentralized web
      (aka web 2.5) using the datachannel and existing browser technology.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>We've all spent a lot of time using centralized video conference services in the last months.
      We have got a huge amount done at home whilst behind NAT on domestic ISP connections.
      This has all been possible due to webRTC's design.</p>

      <p>This talk tries to look beyond that usecase to new less business orientated realtime media and data apps that are enabled by new(ish) APIs.</p>

      <p>For economic,privacy and ecological reasons I'll emphasize apps that move computing to the edge.
      It will cover Baby monitors, robots, yoga classes and P2P web services and other surprising stuff...</p>

Among them are SVG plotting capability, acknowledging RKM notation (e.g. 4k7 for 4.7 KOhm resistance), new and improved convergence methods when calculation the operating point, and many others.</p>

      <p>The second part of the talk discusses some new features under development or still under discussion, like XSPICE memory management improvements, adding BSIMCMG model for FinFETs, adding IBIS capability (together with KiCad and sparselizard), and S parameter intgration. A lot of discussions is going on among FOSS simulator developers and users about better Verilog-A support.</p>

      <p>Serverless computing facilitates the use of resources without the burden of administering and maintaining infrastructure. The simplification of IaaS appears ideal (in theory) but providers and users are presented with several challenges: providers aim to reduce infrastructure maintenance overheads; users require isolation, flexibility and programming freedom.</p>

      <p>Serverless deployments are mostly backed by sandboxed containers. To enable programming freedom for users, providers allow the use of containers for function deployment, however, to ensure strict isolation, these containers are sandboxed in VMs. As a result, this bloated stack brings complicated maintenance costs: (a) several layers of abstraction between the user function to be executed and the actual execution environment; (b) increased attack surface; (c) increased request-to-exec time; (d) reduced set of feature availability for functions (hardware acceleration).</p>

      <p>Unikernels promise fast boot times, small memory footprint and stronger security but lack in terms of manageability. Additionally, Serverless frameworks only support containers. Moreover, unikernels provide a different environment for applications, with limited or no support for widely used libraries and OS features. This issue is even more apparent in the case of ML/AI workloads. ML/AI libraries are often dynamically linked and have numerous dependencies, which directly contradict the statically linked notion of unikernels. Finally, hardware acceleration is almost non-existent in unikernel frameworks, mainly due to the absence of suitable virtualization solutions for such devices.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we present the design of a flexible serverless framework designed for the cloud and the edge, backed by unikernels that can access hardware accelerators. We go through the components that comprise the framework and elaborate on the challenges in building such a software stack: we first present an overview of the necessary components of a serverless framework; then we focus on the function execution framework based on two popular unikernel frameworks; finally, we present a hardware acceleration abstraction to expose semantic acceleration functionality to workloads running on top of this framework.</p>

      <p>A short demo of the working components will be presented, discussing the challenges and trade-offs of this approach.</p>

      <p>It is often said that the modern internet has left vintage computers behind. However, it is not the internet - it is the complexity of content. One way of bringing vintage machines to the modern web is through upgrades and accelerators. This creates a moving target of machines that will still age-out of sufficient upgrade-ability as the web continues to evolve. Another option is to deconstruct the modern web to make it accessible to vintage computers.</p>

      <p>Using an open source library called Readability and some haphazard PHP, I've built two web portals: 68k.news and FrogFind.com. These sites allow vintage machine to view many websites as text-only, by stripping out complicated HTML and scripts and delivering HTML 1.1 content to old browsers, with images optional.</p>

      <p>This talk will cover the idea behind these portals, their use, and just how usable and pleasant a vintage machine can become for daily internet content consumption without the distractions of the modern web.</p>

      <p>It is often said that the modern internet has left vintage computers behind. However, it is not the internet - it is the complexity of content. One way of bringing vintage machines to the modern web is through upgrades and accelerators. This creates a moving target of machines that will still age-out of sufficient upgrade-ability as the web continues to evolve. Another option is to deconstruct the modern web to make it accessible to vintage computers.</p>

      <p>Using an open source library called Readability and some haphazard PHP, I've built two web portals: 68k.news and FrogFind.com. These sites allow vintage machine to view many websites as text-only, by stripping out complicated HTML and scripts and delivering HTML 1.1 content to old browsers, with images optional.</p>

      <p>This talk will cover the idea behind these portals, their use, and just how usable and pleasant a vintage machine can become for daily internet content consumption without the distractions of the modern web.</p>

      is a pragmatic microkernel-based OS with a focus on asynchronous operations.
      The talk covers various aspects of the microkernel, such as its IPC model, resource
      management, and user space API. Managarm's microkernel employs a capability-based
      design to manage hardware resources. In contrast to current mainstream OSes,
      Managarm's system calls never block but report completion asynchronously whenever
      possible. This includes system calls for common tasks such as memory management
      or inter-process communication (IPC). A lock-free ring buffer is used to quickly
      deliver asynchronous completion notifications to user space. Managarm implements
      a POSIX subsystem to be able to run various well-known UNIX applications (e.g.,
      a Wayland desktop) on top of the microkernel. This subsystem is implemented
      entirely in user space. The kernel uses various acceleration strategies to to

      <p>It's been just over a year since all browsers dropped support for Flash, but much Flash content continue to exist both in web archives and on the live web. This presentation will cover various techniques tried by the Webrecorder project to keep Flash content still working in today's browsers, such as running old browsers in containers, running full system emulation in WebAssembly, and using the Ruffle emulator. We will cover the trade-offs between these approaches and the current challenges in combining web archives and emulation, and present the tools we have built to make these approaches possible.</p>

      <p>As one of the options, will also talk about the OldWeb.today project (https://oldweb.today/) which provides several JS-based emulation connected to web archives, how it works and how it can be used to run not only Flash, but also old Java applets that may exist in web archives.</p>

      <p>We will leave time for a Q&amp;A session to answer any questions about the tools and how they could be improved!</p>

      <p>5 years into its life and with vast number of users users, Element - a Matrix messaging client available on most desktop platforms, Android and iOS - had a growing backlog of bugs and enhancement requests. This is a common challenge faced by projects as they mature. I will share some of our lessons learnt and good practices that we have developed, and how our enthusiastic community is helping catch bugs earlier and process our backlog. While we have made good progress, we recognise that there are still further improvements to be made and will share some of our ideas for the future.</p>

      <p>This is the story of how we harnessed the power of the community, automation and good habits to reduce our issue burden and helped users be heard.</p>

      <p>5 years into its life and with vast number of users users, Element - a Matrix messaging client available on most desktop platforms, Android and iOS - had a growing backlog of bugs and enhancement requests. This is a common challenge faced by projects as they mature. I will share some of our lessons learnt and good practices that we have developed, and how our enthusiastic community is helping catch bugs earlier and process our backlog. While we have made good progress, we recognise that there are still further improvements to be made and will share some of our ideas for the future.</p>

    abstract: |-
      <p>Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for
      guiding supply chain security in modern software development
      environments. As an 'ingredients list' of files, package dependencies
      and other artefacts that a piece of software is made up of, Software
      Bill of Materials are becoming an essential part of modern software
      development practices.</p>

      <p>Open source software provides great transparency and can yield rapid
      vulnerability patching, but this is too often compromised by sprawling
      dependency trees which make it difficult to find vulnerable components
      in larger software projects. With SBOMs, there's a way of effectively
      cataloguing software components and the package metadata needed to check
      the integrity, pedigree and provenance of software supply chains. This
      talk will cover the benefits of having a common standard for creating,
      sharing and consuming Software Bill of Materials, what SBOMs should and
      should not contain, and how to use SBOMs to inform security measures
      across the diverse range of package ecosystems.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>In particular, this talk will cover the distinctive qualities of
      effective Software Bill of Materials:</p>

      <p>Immutability - it may be tempting to include known vulnerabilities and
      other dynamic data in SBOMs, but this leads to uncertainty and
      duplication of effort when that data inevitably changes. This talk will
      show how to link dynamic data into SBOMs in a way that maintains the
      SBOM's immutability.</p>

      <p>Verifiability - it's hard to trust an SBOM when you can't verify that
      its contents are correct. Including robust cryptographic hashes is a
      critical part of creating SBOMs. This talk will show how relationships
      in SBOMs can be used to associate the hashes of build artefacts with
      source code, providing a way to trace back to the original projects even
      when programs are statically linked!</p>

      <p>Compatibility - no one program can check for vulnerabilities of all the
      different types and across all package ecosystems, so the use of SBOMs
      as a compatible format for communication between security tools is
      essential for dependency analysis at scale. This talk will cover the
      current state of compatibility between security tools, concluding with
      practical ways that developers can integrate SBOM creation and ingestion
      into their build systems.</p>

    raw_abstract: "<p>ƒÄhau is a FOSS project from Aotearoa New Zealand, built to meet
      the data needs of MƒÅori. This talk will share insights from thinking in a less
      Eurocentric way about data, and how the need for data sovereignty has lead us
      to p2p data models, which fit really well with human-focused systems. Over the
      last 3 years, we've built a desktop application on secure scuttlebutt that is
      currently in use by hap≈´ and iwi (tribal groups) to record family histories
      and create tribal registries.</p>"

      <p>One feature that sets raku apart from other programming languages is the built-in Grammar parser syntax. This provides a concise, clean and extensible tool for parsing text and triggering Actions according to the content. Navigation aids such as buoys and markers sport flashing lights with characteristics such as color, duration, phase, occulting, speed, height, visibility and so on are represented on navigation charts by way of a short code e.g. <code>Fl(4)15s37m28M</code>.</p>

      <p>This talk aims to show how raku provides the average coder (me) with a new practical alternative to Regexs and/or specialist recursive descent modules. It should illustrate how the combination of the raku built-in OO system and Grammars/Actions keeps the problem domain / problem solution in focus via code and visual examples.</p>

    raw_abstract: "<p>Video is foundational to the web experience, representing roughly
      80% of internet bandwidth. Using desktop, mobile and other devices, video is
      how individuals learn, work, create, are entertained, and share their human
      stories. Given that all industries have a need for video and that mainstream
      audiences are increasingly interested in Web3 solutions, understanding the advantages
      of decentralization and openness at technical and user levels is essential if
      these solutions are to be successfully adopted. Join this talk to learn about
      how Livepeer is positioning itself as the video infrastructure layer of web3
      and opportunities for open source contributors to build the future with us.</p>"

      <p>Developing software from academia is not easy. Scholars are meant to teach and write.
      Releasing a research software demands much more than writing code.
      In this panel discussion, the four speakers will share their thoughts on those challenges. The discussion will benefit from the variety of situations they all bring : a "scholar-analyst" collaborating with a tech team, a team of scholars/engineers and a sociologist who codes alone.
      Should scholars leave coding to the professional?
      What does open sourcing code brings to the game?
      What does maintaining a research software require?
      Is coding from academia actually fun or a burden?</p>

      <p>This talk introduces Neighbourhoods: a proposed organizing principle for social spaces on the distributed web using Holochain. We envision ‚Äúgroupware‚Äù (like calendars, simple games, chat, collaborative docs, etc.) decoupled from reputation and group culture metrics (e.g. entry and exit rules, engagement incentives, likes or claps, visibility and feed ordering); in social platforms on the centralized web, these distinct functions are typically combined.
      To facilitate neighbourhoods, we are building a language and ‚Äúinterchange‚Äù for reputation data on Holochain such that users can connect a portable reputation extension to bundles of Holochain groupware.</p>

      <p>Groups can then use the neighbourhoods framework to bundle p2p modules with reputational and cultural inputs that relate to their particular use cases and style of relating. This also means individuals‚Äô reputation and activity records are stored on their devices, and so can be ported to other neighbourhoods and verified using Holochain‚Äôs gossip protocol for data validation. Neighbourhoods is centered on the Holochain ecosystem, but it may also be of interest to dWeb communities and projects aspiring to traffic in ‚Äúricher‚Äù data than ownership claims &amp; token counts - especially when those data support community collective intelligence.</p>

      <p>Much of the system remains to be built, but the core language - <code>rep_lang</code> - has been integrated with Holochain. We‚Äôll close with a brief demo showing one key aspect of the system: <code>rep_lang</code> computations being validated by multiple agents on Holochain.</p>

      <p>The internet is an entire universe. Countless links emerge and die off every minute. Each of us have our own habits and patterns across it. Our browsing is increasingly complex, so it makes no sense why we're still using technology based on filing cabinets -- tabs, files, folders.  Quark is the DWeb browser x social platform that shows you paths across the internet. Imagine if you could bump into someone else looking at similar content/search results, see where they've been, and tag along to discover content together.</p>

      <p>In this presentation, I'll share use cases for The Quark Browser, as well as how this tool can address the existential crises of the siloed Web 2.0 internet by making the internet more serendipitous, visual, and communal.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The internet is bustling with activity, but today we can only meet and interact with others at specific ‚Äúparties.‚Äù  These online "parties" are free to enter, serve free drinks, and play good music. But in exchange, the hosts of these parties sell your information. The Quark Browser asks the question: What if you can meet and interact with like-minded people <em>anywhere</em> on the internet?</p>

      <p>The Quark Browser delivers the decentralized p2p vision of DWeb and makes it accessible to the public, no matter their level of technical understanding. Unlike most Web3 companies which innovate with a financial, privacy, or technical focus, Quark does so from a unique interaction design approach. Our vision is product-focused ‚Äì to build a dynamic, living, and persistent ‚Äúplayground‚Äù that nurtures meaningful social connections. With a business model, technology stack, and experience design that learns from the mistakes of Web 2.0, Quark aims to bring variety and serendipity to the content we discover, connect ideas via relational maps, and help us build peer-to-peer communities of likeminded people all in line with the browsing experience.</p>

      <p>We are a two-person team of multi-time founders ‚Äì Joy, the Founder/CEO, and Sam, the founding Product Designer. This is Joy‚Äôs fourth startup, and Sam‚Äôs second. Sam‚Äôs first startup at age 14 was featured in the Colombian equivalent of ‚ÄúFinancial Times‚Äù and was invited to Shark Tank. He is a Gen-Z self-learner which makes him familiar with the modern pain points in complex browsing. Joy completed a master's thesis on the very problem that Quark solves. She has worked for companies such as Apple, IDEO, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Her undergraduate degree is in mechanical engineering and human-computer interaction from Georgia Tech, and her master's in interdisciplinary design engineering from the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London. We are looking for a CTO/Tech Lead to help lead the technological development.</p>

      <p>Project re-isearch is a novel multimodal search and retrieval engine using mathematical models and algorithms different from the all-too-common inverted index. The design allows it to have, in practice, effectively no limits on the frequency of words, term length, number of fields or complexity of structured data and support even overlap--- where fields or structures cross other's boundaries (common examples are quotes, line/sentences, biblical verse, annotations). Its model enables a completely flexible unit of retrieval and modes of search.
      Developed using a highly portable C++ subset to be RAM efficient, the engine provides also bindings to a number of other languages such as Python, Tcl, Java etc.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>‚ÄúRe-isearch‚Äù is a project following in the spirit of the original isearch developed back in the 1990s.  Reborn in 2020 in the middle of the global Covid19 pandemic as Project re-Isearch.</p>

      <p>Like the original, it is not just about textual words but pushes the envelope. re-Isearch is multi-object, multi-modal and with an unharnessed unit of retrieval.</p>

      <p>Mainstream search engines are about finding any information: "a list of all documents containing a specific word or phrase‚Äù.
      So search engines paradoxically return both too much information (i.e. long lists of links) and too little information (i.e. links to content, not content itself).
      The re-Isearch engine is, by contrast, about exploiting document structure, both implicit (XML and other markup) and explicit (visual groupings such as paragraph), to zero in on relevant sections of documents, not just links to documents. This concept of search granularity is a radical departure from other designs. With typical text indexers one has the concept of document or record and that is the unit of index and the unit of retrieval. Instead we can have a dynamic search time unit of retrieval: user specified or heuristically determined. The structure of of documents can be exploited to identify which document elements (such as the appropriate chapter or page) to retrieve. Retrieval granularity may be on the level of sub-structures of a given document or page such as line, paragraph but may also be as part of a larger collection.</p>

      <p>Like the original, it is not just about textual words but the design contains a large number of objects: numerical, range, geospatial etc. It is unique among full-text systems in that it also provides numerous object types with their own methods of search and allows these to be viewed parallel as text--- a date field (of which it will be one of the first to support some key parts of the new ISO-8601:2019 standard date semantics), for instance, can be searched as a date but also a text, searching for the words in the field.</p>

      <p>The option to choose a decentralized storage network in the stack of your application is far-reaching but perhaps not well understood. In this presentation, I intent to give guidance and understanding by answering the question of when it makes sense to use Swarm in your stack.
      I start with a brief introduction to Swarm after which I highlight 3 (not so) typical applications which already run on top of Swarm. I end by introducing the paradigm shift that we see happening when developers start to explore Swarm and truly get to know what it means for them--the avenues that Swarm opens and the new patterns that can be explored.</p>

      <p>I hope to see you at my presentation and be sure to take all your questions to the live Q&amp;A!</p>

      <p>This talk will explore how we can bring open source collaboration to building and running cloud services. We present our vision of "Open Cloud Services" that provide the same openness and freedom to users and developers as open-source software. But running a cloud service requires resources so how can that be funded? An ideal solution would be simple, equitable and fair -- and not compromise the ethos of open source. We'll discuss our attempt at solving this puzzle, a funding mechanism we call cloud funding.
      Next, we'll introduce Unfurl, our DevOps tool for building reproducible, cloud-provider independent open cloud services and then look to future Web3 and decentralization technologies that make this possible -- specifically how blockchain-based decentralized data and remote attestation, transparent and reproducible open cloud services, and next-generation secure-computing cloud infrastructure all combine to provide the building blocks of a free and open cloud.</p>

    description: |-
      <p>Open Source communities operate on a set of values that include a commitment to inclusion and diversity.  The idea that the Tech Ecosystem at large is faced with the challenges of Diversity and Inclusion is not a myth.
       To everyone, there is a level of implicit bias and beliefs about various social and identity groups to some degree. Implicit biases are the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner.
       Studies have shown that the majority of the problems posed by diversity and inclusion result from implicit bias. As users, maintainers and contributors of Open Source Software, we may have encountered different marginalized groups that have shared their encounters of bias in Open Source communities.
        Most persons are ignorant of this bias and its impact on the victims. In an Open Source Project, a typical example of implicit bias could be, assuming that a female employee will be less competent for a role compared to a male employee.
       In this session, I will be talking about: What Diversity and Inclusion is, Why Diversity and Inclusion matter? Challenges faced by underrepresented groups in open source communities, Identifying Bias, What implicit Bias is, The different forms of implicit Bias, Why it is important to create awareness of this bias and How these biases can be improved.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúThe more languages your software knows, the more of a satisfied users you have". However, current software localization in modern JS frameworks and other software is complicated and fairly time-consuming for all involved participants. Thanks to the in-context localization feature of open-source project Tolgee, this tool offers easier localization process, more relevant translations delivery and finally less work for developers.</p>

      <p>The workshop will contain live demo where I would like to describe using Tolgee JavaScript software development kits on simple React.js web application example. However, Tolgee is currently compatible with other frameworks such as Angular, Svelte, Vue.js or Next.js.</p>

      <p>Participants will learn easy localization workflow using by Tolgee tool, simple localization texts management, how to integrate Tolgee into web app in less than one minute, how to take advantage of different Tolgee features as e.g. automatic generation of screenshots or in-context localization.</p>

      <p>Behavior Graph is a software architecture and state management library. It greatly enhances your ability to write complex user facing software and control systems.</p>

      <p>Broadly speaking, it belongs to the category of libraries which includes Redux, MobX, Rx (Reactive Extensions), and XState.</p>

      <p>It works by providing a new unit of composition which we call the behavior. Behaviors are simple blocks of code together with their dependency relationships.</p>

      <p>We developed Behavior Graph to address our own complexity challenges while building an iOS video playing library which is used internally throughout the suite of native Yahoo mobile apps. After years of development and production usage, it has proven to be incredibly competent at scale.</p>

      <p>We have since ported it to multiple languages including Javascript/Typescript. It is less than 1500 lines of code and contains no external dependencies.</p>

      <p>Behavior Graph should appeal to anyone with an interest in software architectures and willingness to rethink how we write software applications.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Behavior Graph makes the dependency relationships between blocks of code its primary responsibility. We believe these relationships are the main source of complexity in most applications. Behavior Graph asks programmers to explicitly declare these dependency relationships. In exchange, it ensures that blocks of code are run at the correct time and in the correct order. As a result, the programmer is freed to reason locally about contained units of functionality, while the computer takes on the increasing complexity burden as an application grows in size.</p>

      <p>In the presentation we will introduce the primary abstractions provided by Behavior Graph. We will do this by working through a simple example of how the library works with code samples. Then we will show how these pieces hold together as an architecture.</p>

      <p>We will briefly touch on how it compares to similarly positioned libraries. Finally we will look at the current state of the library and a roadmap for the future.</p>

      <p>Emulators, especially ones targeting real time performance, can become very complex, and can present unique debugging challenges - more akin to cpu, operating system and compilers than typical software projects.</p>

      <p>In this talk I will cover common and not-so-common classes of bugs that manifest themselves in a vast range of emulators (gameboy, dreamcast, x86/64 usermode will be used as examples), and strategies and heuristics I've used over the years to identify, prevent, mitigate, fix and prevent them from reappearing.</p>

      <p>Both theoretical concepts and background, as well as concrete examples of past bug hunts will be included.</p>

Shorter release cycle are still possible without hindering quality teams or users.</p>

      <p>The security of the whole system is not determined only by the software it runs, but also by the firmware. Firmware is a piece of software inseparable from the hardware. It is responsible for proper hardware initialization as well as its security features. That means that the safety of the machine strongly depends on the mitigations of vulnerabilities provided by firmware (like microcode updates, bug/exploit fixes). For these particular reasons, the firmware should be kept up-to-date.</p>

      <p>Routers are highly popular attack vectors, therefore they must be appropriately secured. pfSense and OPNsense are well known secure firewall and routing software, but they do not have any firmware update methods. Therefore to secure hardware initialization of the routers, in this presentation we will present proof of concept work that takes into consideration integration of firmware update framework - fwupd/LVFS.</p>

      <p>Nowadays, this is one of the most popular firmware update software. fwupd is a daemon that manages firmware updates of each of your hardware components that have some kind of firmware. What is more fwupd is open source, which makes it more trustworthy than proprietary applications delivered by hardware vendors designed for (only) their devices.</p>

However, this comes at a cost of accessibility and usability, as well as diminishing the physical connection one might have to the device they are using. Physical interfaces are now much easier to develop, and can even be constructed by the end user, since MCUs are now very cheap and readily available, along with lots of modular parts to construct interfaces with. Web Serial provides the added benefit of being able to use the highly distributed and easy to code with JavaScript / Web platform with these MCUs.

      <h2>Abstract</h2>

      <p>In this presentation we discuss the Conversational Agent (CA) designs for two closely related problem areas:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>Data Acquisition Workflows (DAWs)</p></li>
      <li><p>Data Transformation Workflows (DTWs)</p></li>
      </ul>


      <p>The CA perspective is taken mostly for exposition and didactic purposes. Nevertheless, we emphasise the practical applicability of the underlying designs and implementations.</p>

      <p>Although, operationally data acquisitions are prerequisite for data wrangling we discuss data wrangling first -- the corresponding DTWs designs and implementations are more mature and the related materials are more universal, applicable to multiple programming languages.</p>

      <h2>Outline</h2>

      <h3>Data Wrangling</h3>

      <p>In the first part of the presentation we show and compare data wrangling examples in different programming languages using different packages.</p>

      <p>Here is a list of the programming languages and packages we consider:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>Julia-DataFrames</p></li>
      <li><p>Python-pandas</p></li>
      <li><p>R</p></li>
      <li><p>R-tidyverse</p></li>
      <li><p>WL</p></li>
      </ul>


      <p>We look into the common data wrangling workflows and how we can design a conversational agent that translates natural language commands into data wrangling code for Julia, Python, R, SQL, WL.</p>

      <p>WL's external evaluator features are heavily utilized.</p>

      <h3>Data Acquisition Workflows</h3>

      <p>In the second part of the presentation we discuss the following facets of a data acquisition system:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>Conversational Agent based on a Finite State Machine</p></li>
      <li><p>Gathering and utilizing metadata taxonomies</p></li>
      <li><p>The making of datasets recommender systems and search engines</p>

      <ul>
      <li>In/for both R and WL</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><p>Making (ingredient) variables queries</p></li>
      <li><p>Introspection queries</p></li>
      <li><p>Random data generation specifications</p></li>

      <p>As a reverse proxy for MySQL databases, ProxySQL is being used in various infrastructure sizes and it is not surprising to see deployments with thousands of nodes running. Such large deployments introduce some interesting challenges because nodes can be initialized or destroyed at any time.
      This session will describe the challenges in configuring such large deployments of nodes, the most common external tools to configure ProxySQL, and then focus on improved ProxySQL native clustering solutions that allows auto-discovery, bootstrap, and a distributed decentralized reconfiguration.</p>

      <p>The FOSS Communities have been debating how to manage security, sustainability and funding of FOSS for years but today a global and political lens is being shone on them.</p>

      <p>Commercial debates over licensing and revenue models around FOSS based businesses peak in 2021 with the Elastic transition away from FOSS to an SSPL licence and the fallout and debate from this.</p>

      <p>The European Commission's Digital Decade is clear that its basis will be a FOSS infrastructure and Europe has been passing laws and regulations to support its open first approach, as it seeks digital and data sovereignty.</p>

      <p>The inevitable success and adoption of FOSS in our national infrastructures and recent security issues have the minds of Governments focused on FOSSS, to the extent that the White House plans a meeting to discuss FOSS security in January having issued an ordinance recommending the use of Software Bill of Materials.</p>

      <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has shared a 5 year software plan saying "software defines the world of the future, open source determines the future of software," as it plans global collaboration to improve its open source activities.</p>

      <p>In the UK, hosting COP26 shone a spotlight on energy and the UK Energy Sector Digitalisation Task force which has already suggested Open Data, will consider the use of open source software by default in its recommendations to Government in January. Whilst the NHS' data strategy issued in 2021 requires that open source software should be the default in healthcare.</p>

      <p>This talk will stitch together these global threads, laws and policies to take a holistic view on the insurmountable success of FOSS in the last decade and the inevitable challenges being faced as a consequence of that success and the very nature and heart of FOSS in the Commons.</p>

      <p>Sharing some policy suggestions and thoughts this talk will consider whether it may be time to shift the landscape. Is 2022 the year to recognise the need for FOSS to be characterised as a public good and to secure the interaction not only of business but of the State in funding and securing FOSS in the long term? How can this ensure sustainability of FOSS through its maintenance and sustainability of the planet by elevating the role of FOSS within environmental sustainability?</p>

      <p>With a deep consideration of recent economic and policy discussions this keynote talk with pull many strands together to start 2022 with a focus on FOSS, funding and a secure and sustainable future.</p>

      <p>A quick study on several popular MQTT brokers!</p>

      <p>We will learn about the benefits of MQTT, which has become the de facto standard for IoT messaging.  The MQTT protocol has in fact undergone a major transformation from its early days as a protocol for handling data transmission in oil pipelines via satellite, to now being able to manage devices operating in the current internet and cloud native environments that are often constrained.  We'll take a look at some of the popular implementations of the MQTT broker, such as the Java-based HiveMQ  and the C/C++ Eclipse Mosquitto.</p>
    description: "<p>IoT applications run on IoT devices and can be created to be
      specific to almost every industry and vertical, from small devices to large
      ones, including healthcare, industrial automation, smart homes and buildings,
      automotive, and wearable technology. The possibilities are limitless. Increasingly,
      IoT applications are using AI and machine learning to add intelligence to devices.
      Among all of the variables in the IoT ecosystem, one common theme is the need
      to be able to handle the constrained operating environment, such as unreliable
      network connectivity, limited bandwidth, low battery power, and so on. We will
      take a look into the MQTT protocol, how it has evolved from its early days which
      was intended for the connection of oil pipelines via satellite, to now the ever-increasing
      demand in IoT and M2M applications, to how this protocol will evolve to meet
      the modern needs especially in the current cloud computing era. We will study

      <p>Back when Alexander88207 started using FreeBSD, there was no useful utility to setup games or launcher in wine, so he created one.
      Suyimazu was developed from pure fun, so please do not take it too seriously.
      Suyimazu was created with some inspiration from lutris, but is not meant to be a substitute.</p>

      <p>Suyimazu is a launcher that makes it easy to run Windows games/launcher easily on FreeBSD by providing/applying the required fixes and workarounds.</p>

      <p>This is the 3rd edition of the "Status of AMD platform in coreboot". The talk
      will cover the most recent news around the AMD support in open source firmware
      ecosystem and updates of the topics covered in previous years. We would like to
      present status of FSF RYF KGPE-D16 platform revival and related upstreaming
      effort, TrenchBoot progress for AMD platforms and status of recent support in
      coreboot and oreboot projects. Finally we would like to present Dasharo - open
      source firmware distribution with long term stable support for older AMD
      platforms.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The history of AMD cooperation in coreboot projects reaches 2007 where the
      first contribution appeared for the Geode LX processors. AMD's open-source
      support continued for many years until now (with some break). This presentation
      will briefly repeat the history of AMD and open source firmware. Moreover,
      recent coreboot releases started to enforce certain requirements on the
      features supported by the silicon code base. Aging platforms kept losing
      interest and many of them (including fully open ones) starting to cause
      unjustifiable overhead, because of accumulated technical debt. Most probably it
      will result in similar situation as with famous 4.11 branch becoming de facto
      stable branch for some platforms (e.g. FSP1.0 Bay Trail or ASUS KGPE-D16).
      Nowadays AMD is releasing the newest AGESA with the cooperation of hired
      coreboot developers, but charter covers modern Ryzen-based processors. We
      trying to support the AMD platforms by reimplementing the ASUS KGPE-D16 (FSF
      RYF platform) support in coreboot and keeping the PC Engines platforms in the
      top of tree. We would like to present Dasharo plan for long term stable and
      sustainable support for older platforms. If you are interested in open source
      firmware for most open x86 platforms on the market feel free to tune in and
      discuss the ideas with us.</p>

      will cover the most recent news around the AMD support in open source firmware
      ecosystem and updates of the topics covered in previous years. We would like to
      present status of FSF RYF KGPE-D16 platform revival and related upstreaming
      effort, TrenchBoot progress for AMD platforms and status of recent support in
      coreboot and oreboot projects. Finally we would like to present Dasharo - open
      source firmware distribution with long term stable support for older AMD
      platforms.</p>
    raw_description: |-
      <p>The history of AMD cooperation in coreboot projects reaches 2007 where the
      first contribution appeared for the Geode LX processors. AMD's open-source
      support continued for many years until now (with some break). This presentation
      will briefly repeat the history of AMD and open source firmware. Moreover,
      recent coreboot releases started to enforce certain requirements on the
      features supported by the silicon code base. Aging platforms kept losing
      interest and many of them (including fully open ones) starting to cause
      unjustifiable overhead, because of accumulated technical debt. Most probably it
      will result in similar situation as with famous 4.11 branch becoming de facto
      stable branch for some platforms (e.g. FSP1.0 Bay Trail or ASUS KGPE-D16).
      Nowadays AMD is releasing the newest AGESA with the cooperation of hired
      coreboot developers, but charter covers modern Ryzen-based processors. We
      trying to support the AMD platforms by reimplementing the ASUS KGPE-D16 (FSF
      RYF platform) support in coreboot and keeping the PC Engines platforms in the
      top of tree. We would like to present Dasharo plan for long term stable and
      sustainable support for older platforms. If you are interested in open source
      firmware for most open x86 platforms on the market feel free to tune in and
      discuss the ideas with us.</p>

      <p>The broadcasting industry has for years been dominated by a well known and specific set of technologies (RTMP, HLS, etc.). These solutions do work and are widely deployed, taking advantage of CDNs for distributing streams to a potentially very large audience in an effective way. That said, they do suffer from some limitations, the stronger one being a high latency that cannot really be reduced, if not slightly. Considering there are scenarios where a very low latency may be desired, WebRTC has started to gain some traction, due to its real-time nature that, although originally conceived for conversational scenarios, has actually often used for streaming purposes as well.</p>

      <p>When it comes to broadcasting, there are two main aspects to take into account: ingestion (providing a stream to broadcast) and distribution (feeding the stream to an audience). The IETF has started addressing ingestion in the WISH Working Group, with a draft describing the WHIP protocol. This presentation will introduce what WHIP is, its requirements, and how it's supposed to work, plus some details on existing implementations. It will then move to some considerations on how distribution could be handled via WebRTC as well, possibly at scale, using the open source Janus WebRTC Server as a reference implementation.</p>

      <p>Welcome to SweetAda.</p>

      <p>SweetAda is a lightweight development framework whose purpose is the implementation of Ada-based software systems.</p>

      <p>The code produced by SweetAda is able to run on a wide range of machines, from ARM¬Æ embedded boards up to x86-64-class machines, as well as MIPS¬Æ machines and Virtex¬Æ/Spartan¬Æ PowerPC¬Æ/MicroBlaze¬Æ FPGAs. It could theoretically run even on System/390¬Æ IBM¬Æ mainframes (indeed it runs on the Hercules emulator). SweetAda is not an operating system, however it includes a set of both low- and high-level primitives and kernel services, like memory management, PCI bus handling, FAT mass-storage handling, which could be used as building blocks in the construction of complex software-controlled devices.</p>

      <p>SweetAda has some distinctive characteristics, like:
      - is ROMable
      - uses a ZFP run-time
      - has no dependencies; neither external libraries nor underlying code are needed</p>

      <p>SweetAda has a complete toolchain (assembler, linker, Ada compiler and debugger), and optionally you could even use a machine emulator, which can execute the final output code inside a virtual target. In order to use SweetAda, a decent POSIX¬Æ environment with a Bash shell and GNU Make are required. For a Linux¬Æ workstation this is quite standard, while for a Windows¬Æ machine you can download and install either MSYS2 (preferred) or Cygwin¬Æ. Anyway, SweetAda toolchains for Windows have an integrated Make suited for a Windows CLI. Being completely makefile- and script- driven, SweetAda is completely configurable and has many hooks which allow an easy integration in a GUI environment such as, e.g., Eclipse, KDE Kate or Visual Studio Code. Insight debugger is also available.</p>

      <p>SweetAda comes with high-quality GNU toolchains based on modern official FSF Binutils/GCC/GDB releases, unpatched and compiled with strictly controlled options. The emulators are mainly based on the latest QEMU‚Ñ¢ official release, augmented with the IOEMU physical I/O system, which allows software code to interact with a visual environment.</p>

      <p>To make SweetAda generic and, at the same time, reliable, it is regularly tested against an heterogeneous set of machines which are able to successfully execute the system code, e.g.:
      - PC-style PIIX3/PIIX4 motherboards (ROM-boot)
      - DECstation 5000/133 MIPS R3000 (ROM-boot)
      - Memec FX12 Virtex-4 PPC405 (JTAG-boot)
      - DigiNS7520 board ARM7TDMI (JTAG-boot)
      - Terasic DE10-Lite Nios¬ÆII softcore (JTAG-boot)
      - MVME1600-011 PPC603 VME board (JTAG-boot)
      - Force SPARC¬Æ/CPU-3CE VME board (ROM-boot)
      - M5235BCC ColdFire development board (ROM-boot)
      - SPARCstation‚Ñ¢ 5 (ROM-boot)
      - Spartan 3E MicroBlaze softcore (JTAG-boot)
      - Raspberry Pi‚Ñ¢ 3 ARMv8 (microSD-boot)</p>

      <p>The SweetAda software code is compiled by a build machinery which enforces a very high severity level. Usefulness, simplicity and expandability rather than extreme or obscure optimizations are the key features behind the project. Nevertheless, SweetAda grants the possibility of employ appropriate customizations, down to machine code level, to satisfy specific needs.</p>

      <p>SweetAda is in a state of steady growth. BSPs, device drivers, a TLSF memory allocator, TCP/IP basic functionalities, as well as low-level CAN primitives are under heavy development. More target machines and additional feautures/modules such as intrinsic floating point support and expanded SFP runtimes are scheduled in future releases, as well as language tools and system utilities, like ASIS.</p>

      <p>Please note that the platform-specific code included in SweetAda is given as an example. The emphasis of SweetAda is not about operating system design, but rather on exploiting the Ada language everywhere.</p>

      <p>Progressive Web Apps are web applications that have been designed, so they are capable, reliable, and installable. These three pillars transform them into an experience that feels like a platform-specific application.
      The central core components that ensure that PWA works flawlessly are Service Workers. These components are a network proxy that takes control of a network request from the application and adds cache capabilities, background app sync, push notifications, and offline features.
      In this talk, I will review the PWA capabilities in Flutter and show you how you can extend these functionalities to have a better progressive web app building with Flutter in order to boost user experience in your application</p>

      <p>In this session, I go into more detail about some other interesting changes that are not language features but are a good reason to switch to JDK 17.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Improvements in the Class Data Sharing feature.</li>
      <li>JDK Flight Recorder for monitoring purposes.</li>
      <li>Improvements in Performances in the Garbage collectors</li>
      <li>Preventing security issues with context-specific deserialization filters.</li>

      <p>Besides the explanation, you also see these changes in action with some demos.</p>

      <p>ScummVM reached a milestone with the release of 2.5.0. Version 0.0.1 was released 20 years ago. The latest release was also the first release that included support for a few Director games.</p>

      <p>MacroMedia Director, later Adobe Director, was a multimedia application authoring platform. Its ease of use led to a huge number of graphic adventure games being written with it. This was the late 90's. Some well known games are the Journeyman Project, Total Distortion and Space Warlock.</p>

      <p>One challenge to over come was to work on the code without breaking other parts.

      <p>There are many WiFi chips around each one. The WiFi router, the smart light, the TV, the phone, etc., all have WiFi chips inside. Ever imagine replacing those chips with an open-source design?</p>

      <p>The openwifi project (https://github.com/open-sdr/openwifi) has been online for more than 2 years. We have paved solid steps towards an open-source WiFi chip. Now if you have commercial off the shelf FPGA boards, you can download our design onto your board and start to use this FPGA based WiFi in the same way as other commercial WiFi chips!</p>

      <p>Mocking typically involves reflection: an efficient mocker can create implementations of interfaces or even concrete classes on the go by reflecting on their methods and properties.
      These required capabilities do not exist in Kotlin/Multiplatform, so we will explore an alternative method to runtime reflection: a compile-time symbol processor.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Using Mocking as an excuse, we will explore how we can use KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processor) to circumvent the absence of reflection and generate efficient mocks at compile time. We will also see the limitations that multiplatform brings to both the KSP Mocker generator and its associated runtime. We will explain the choices that we made when developing the MocKMP multiplatform mocking library, and why they were needed. We will then demonstrate the clean DSL API we offer to describe and verify your mocks.
      Finally, we will demonstrate how to architecture all these moving parts (KSP plugin, mocker generator, mocker runtime) using a custom Gradle Plugin to make using MocKMP as easy as it gets.</p>

      <p>In 2021 Kotlin turned 10 and the team delivered 2 major releases (1.5.0 and 1.6.0) and a few minors. The main themes of those releases were Java interoperability and consistency of the language features. Meanwhile, Kotlin/JS has been promoted to Beta and KMM is on its path to reaching Beta status as well. However, one long-running project in Kotlin is the development of the new compiler, K2, which should set a solid foundation for the language and the ecosystem for the years ahead.</p>

      <p>This session is an overview of the latest developments in Kotlin: the language, tools, compiler, and the ecosystem around it. We're also going to take a look at Kotlin's roadmap to see where are we heading. Come and learn what's new and exciting!</p>

      <p>Security design is an very important step in the software development. In order to meet the principle of least privilege, developers make rules for applications based on data flow and control flow of processes, such as SELinux and AppArmor. This step can be automated with secPaver. With the permission description of application, secPaver can generate security policy for different security mechanisms. By this way, security design can be simplified, and developers do not need to know many details about security mechanisms.</p>

      <p>secPaver is a policy development tool that supports multiple security mechanisms. It aims to help users implement end-to-end security policy development, including visible policy design, iterative development, and policy release. It provides functions such as policy configuration, automatic generation, running test, missing rule gathering, and policy package export. secPaver shields security mechanism details and abstracts unified policy configuration file definitions and operation interfaces for different security mechanisms, improving policy development efficiency and reducing learning costs for developers.</p>

      <p>For applications in Kubernetes, CSI provides a way to consume file/block storage for their workloads. The main motivation behind the Container Object Storage Interface is to provide a similar experience for Object Store. Basic idea is to provide a generic, dynamic provisioning API to consume the object store and the app pods can access the bucket in the underlying object-store like a PVC. The major challenge for this implementation there is no standard protocol defined for object and the COSI project need to be vendor agonistic. For example, in the case of RGW, the application can request for S3 bucket and Swift bucket from the same ceph-cosi driver. Ideally, the Kubernetes resource for the bucket can be migrated to the different cloud if the drivers support it and the application can seamlessly continue with the same k8s object. It won't handle the orchestration/management of object store, rather it will be another client and provide bucket access on behalf of applications running in Kubernetes.
      A similar session was given in last FOSDEM'21, but the whole project went through design changes and will share that information.</p>

      <p>Currently, to access storage, many different type of Volume Plugins are used. But many of them like "FlexVolume" and "In-tree" are either OLD, or deprecated.</p>

      <p>In our talk, we wish to discuss the solution of the same, by sharing information about the different types of volume plugins; and demonstrating the migration procedure from deprecated plugins to the latest "CEPH-CSI"(https://github.com/ceph/ceph-csi); with a pre-recorded demo of the same.</p>

      <p>With seemingly insatiable demand for and growth of data within the organizations, secure and quick movement of the data often becomes a challenge in any Hybrid Cloud enviroment. The external tools and multi-cloud gateway providers add overhead to the latency and may not leverage full capabilities of On-Prem infrastructure.

      <p>More than time to change this.</p>

      <p>In this talk I will explain why data cooperatives will change the existing privacy paradigm and how this can boost the UX for FLOSS.

      <p>In this talk we will set out how secure and high-integraty aspects of systems will or should be reflected in the development of firmware for a wide-range of devices.</p>

      <p>Trusted computing, remote attestation and the unbiquitous TPM (not forgetting Pluton and friends) are all well known technologies. Indeed a trusted computing base requires firmware with specific capabilies that promote certain aspects of immutability, identity and integrity measurements - if these properties are provides then we have the start of a chain of trust and a measurement and identity mechanism that allows that device to be "attestable".  The further property of being "trustable" needs more explanation but refers to the core root of trust measurement and how this is established, amongst other requirements.</p>

      <p>Once we have a collection of attestable (and trustable) devices then remote attestation offers us the possibility of trust relationships between those devices leading to higher-level trust capabilities and integration with supply-chain and forensics.</p>

      <p>To further demonstrate this we have developed case studies from the medical and railway verticals based upon edge cloud and 5G communications. As part of this talk we will use these safety-critical domains as the drivers for a wider and more integrated trusted computing base and ultimately the requiremnts towards firmware and hardware that sits at the core of this.</p>

    raw_abstract: '<p>The increased need for secure firmware of all kinds in "IoT"
      devices from simple sensors to SBC''s capable of running large operating systems
      (eg: Pis, IMXx boards etc) is well known and being driven by many forces, eg:
      Industry 4.0, 5G, 6G etc.   What interestingly is missing is how this firmware
      provides additional security beyond that of the individual device:  to the system
      as a whole, supply-chain provenance and applications; then further on to how
      we deal with security incidents through the added forensics and analysis of
      these devices. Finally we reach the impact of secure firmware to safety-critical

      <p>AVX-512 is a set of vector assembly instructions available on Intel Xeon Phi processors (for example, Skylake). To allow Valgrind analyze the code compiled with these instructions, they have to be explicitly enabled in Valgrind.
      The presentation will briefly describe the specifics of AVX-512 instructions and describe in more detail the way it is has been prototyped in Valgrind.</p>

      <p>In this lightning talk we will introduce an open source project called microshift and demonstrate how microshift can run and manage workloads on disconnected far edge devices by making frugal use of system resources. We will demonstrate managing edge deployments that can tolerate severe networking constraints, update/rollback securely, safely, speedily, and seamlessly, esp without disrupting workloads, and build on and integrate cleanly with edge-optimized OSes like Fedora IoT. Microshift can be used as a development tool, we provide a MicroShift image that bundles host dependencies like CRI-O and useful tools like the kubectl client, so it can run on most modern Linux distros, on OSX, and on Windows.</p>

      <p>I have reimplemented the Plan 9 cpu command in pure Go, available at github.com/u-root/cpu. It uses the ssh transport protocol for data, and the 9p protocol for file system traffic.</p>

      <p>If you are used to ssh, cpu will look very similar, to the point of even honoring your .ssh/config! What's different is that when you cpu from your local note to a remote node, file systems of your choosing are visible on the remote node, mounted over 9p, connected to a server running in the cpu command itself. Translation: you don't ever need to talk to a sysadmin to get network mounts set up. Want to use programs from your local node, libraries from your node, and see your home directory? No problem, run with the default namespace. Is the node a different architecture, but you want to use your /home? No problem, just tailor the CPU<em>NAMESPACE variable, e.g.: CPU</em>NAMESPACE=/home:/bin=/arm/bin:/usr=/arm/usr:/lib=/arm/lib cpu cat /proc/cpuinfo. Want all this from power-on/reset? No problem, we embed kernels and a cpu daemon in flash on any of x86, ARM, ARM64, and RISC-V. Want to embed a cpu capability into your Go program? No problem there is a simple package that implements the Go exec.Command interface. Want to understand cpu? No problem, it's easy to read, consisting of 1164 lines of code for the client and 799 for the server.</p>

      <p>Flatcar Container Linux is a minimal base OS to run containers.
      As a friendly fork of CoreOS Container Linux it continues the project under a new name.
      The main features are the A/B partitions for automatic updates and rollbacks, and the integration of Ignition for declarative configuration on first boot.
      Declarative configuration is a key element for managing machines following the principle of Immutable Infrastructure, but causes friction if it means that the whole machine has to be reprovisioned for configuration changes.
      With Ansible instead of Ignition for the configuration management we can find a compromise by giving up on avoiding configuration drift due to leftovers of old configurations and their side effects.
      Out of this experience the idea was born to rerun Ignition on configuration changes.
      While the big hammer method is to reformat the filesystem and losing application data, a more fine-grained solution could exist by clearing only parts of the filesystem.
      This talk shows how to use Flatcar Container Linux with Terraform, Ignition, and Ansible, and ends with a proof-of-concept demo for Flatcar Container Linux to allow configuration changes through Ignition while avoiding configuration drift.</p>

      <p>With the Foreman Project dropping support for EL7 in Foreman 3.3 (~Summer 2022), it's finally time to tackle that migration to EL8 you have been putting off for a while now.
      In this session we will present various ways how you can migrate your installation from EL7 to EL8, with the main focus on the in-place upgrade using LEAPP/ELevate.</p>

      <p>The Foreman Project is planning to <a href="https://community.theforeman.org/t/deprecation-plans-for-foreman-on-el7-debian-10-and-ubuntu-18-04/25008">drop support for EL7-based deployments in Foreman 3.3</a>, mostly due to the fact that EL7 is considered "feature complete" and there are no further updates (besides security fixes) planned for it.
      Contrary to <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/release-notes/ch-upgrading.en.html">Debian</a> or <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/dnf-system-upgrade/">Fedora</a>, EL-based distributions aren't designed to be upgraded in-place without special tooling. This tooling exists in form of the <a href="https://leapp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">LEAPP project</a> for RHEL and the <a href="https://almalinux.org/elevate">ELevate</a> fork by AlmaLinux for AlmaLinux, CentOS, Rocky Linux, and Oracle Linux.
      We have developed a plugin for LEAPP that helps with the Foreman-specific parts of the migration, which we would like to present to you. As usual, there were a few challenges during the development, which will hopefully entertain you and maybe even help if you need to write own LEAPP plugins.
      And last but not least, we will also discuss other approaches you can take for the migration, if you do not want to upgrade in-place.</p>

      <p>An introduction (live demo with questions and answers) into RPort - a new open-source software for remote access and remote management of heterogeneous it-landscapes. Use the UI, the command line or an REST API to manage servers and desktop efficiently from a central place.</p>

      <p>RPort is a comprehensive solution for remote management of servers and desktop systems. Even if they are behind firewalls, routers and NAT. RPort is built on the client-server principle, clients connect to the server, the management component, using a secure reverse tunnel. Unlike pure SSH, RPort is made for heterogeneous environments (Windows, Linux, macOS) and addresses four basic needs of system administrators:
      ‚Ä¢  Secure remote access from anywhere via tunnels and SSH/RDP/VNC/HTTP and other TCP connections
      ‚Ä¢  Script and command execution on target machines via a central dashboard.
      ‚Ä¢  Automation of recurring tasks such as updates, inventory, configuration and fine-tuning of systems.
      ‚Ä¢  Monitoring and logging system load and resource usage.</p>

      <p>With RPort, a complete IT infrastructure with Windows, Linux and macOS systems can be managed via command line or a convenient web-based, central dashboard. The server component can be self-hosted or deployed in minutes using the automated installer provided by RPort.
      RPort is released under the MIT open-source license.</p>

      <p>The use of Bare Metal to run containerized workload is coming back into popularity.
      There are multiple reasons for this increase of interest. First, the rise of big data analytics, high performance computing, machine learning workloads that need high-bandwidth and low latency and sometimes even requires access to special hardware devices like GPUs or DPUs. And at the same time, in the telecommunication space, the 5G networks technology stacks that drive the need for IPv6, SR-IOV, Container Network Functions (CNFs), NUMA topologies, and other innovations in containerized applications on bare metal.</p>

      <p>All of these emphasize the need for the ability to easily create Bare Metal based OpenShift clusters as automatically as possible.</p>

      <p>Central Infrastructure Management (CIM) exposes an intuitive user interface, allowing the infrastructure administrator to define a pool of Bare Metal machines making them available for users to independently create OpenShift clusters from them.</p>

      <p>Assisted Installer is an operator that introduces a new way to deploy a new OpenShift cluster on bare metal basically by only booting the nodes that will be part of the cluster, with an ISO it generates. The Assisted Installer will report inventory, run validations and orchestrate the needed steps based on the user parameters.</p>

      <p>CIM and Assisted Installer are components of Open Cluster Management (OCM), an operator that enables a single OCP cluster to manage a fleet of clusters.</p>

      <p>In this session, you will learn about Central Infrastructure Management and Assisted Installer architecture and its components. We will discuss the installation flow and how the components interact with each other. Finally, we will demonstrate how to build a pool of Bare Metal and install an OpenShift cluster on them via the CIM user interface.</p>

      <p>Assisted Installer is an operator that introduces a new way to deploy a new OpenShift cluster on bare metal basically by only booting the nodes that will be part of the cluster, with an ISO it generates. The Assisted Installer will report inventory, run validations and orchestrate the needed steps based on the user parameters.</p>

      <p>CIM and Assisted Installer are components of Open Cluster Management (OCM), an operator that enables a single OCP cluster to manage a fleet of clusters.</p>

      <p>In this session, you will learn about Central Infrastructure Management and Assisted Installer architecture and its components. We will discuss the installation flow and how the components interact with each other. Finally, we will demonstrate how to build a pool of Bare Metal and install an OpenShift cluster on them via the CIM user interface.</p>

      <p>With redpesk, we provide customers the ability to cross-build an embedded, CentOS Stream-based Linux distribution in the cloud. This requires a significant infrastructure: Koji/RPM builders, Angular-based WebUI, Gitlab forge, network and RPM package dependency management, Qemu test lab management, all need to come together and be connected, in a mix of Qemu virtual machines and LXC containers. Fortunately, Ansible and Proxmox comes to the rescue to manage this complexity.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we'll present our architecture of a self-contained CI/CD environment in the cloud, to cross-build RPM packages and Linux images. We will then dive into the specifics of using Ansible to drive Proxmox and deploy a mix of Packer-built Qemu virtual machines and LXC containers. Those provide a full Koji build system (hub and builders), an Angular frontend, Go backend, a Gitlab forge as well as network isolation/firewalling and a Qemu virtual target lab.
      We'll continue with lessons learned from doing these deployments for multiple customers. We will finish describing solutions we are currently working on, like Ansible AWX, to address the challenges of doing it at scale and increase automation.</p>

      <p>CUE (https://cuelang.org/) solves a previously unsolved technical problem in the configuration space. It does so by taking a compositional approach that reduces the complexity of managing configuration from a combinatorial problem to a linear problem. CUE is based on 20 years of experience in the field of configuration. Its declarative, aspect-oriented approach is powerful yet simple, making it possible to manage large amounts of configuration data and policies in multiple formats (JSON, YAML, Protocol Buffers, OpenAPI, etc.) with relative ease.
      It also makes CUE well suited to a wide range of applications.</p>

      <p>This all sounds great! But for someone new to CUE, it may not be obvious how to get started.</p>

      <p>In this talk, Marcel van Lohuizen and Paul Jolly start with a quick overview of CUE the language, then move on to present practical examples of CUE in action, including common patterns for validation, policy, integration with existing non-CUE configuration and more. Because CUE is new, established patterns are still in the making, but at the very least it will be a reflection of the current thinking.</p>

      <p>No previous experience of CUE required, although familiarity with an existing configuration and data languages will help provide some context to the examples.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we'll describe how OpenSecurityTraining2 (OST2) can help grow security talent and awareness on open source projects, and we'll use the coreboot open source firmware as a case study.</p>

      <p>Newly structured as a 501c3 non-profit, OST2's core goal is to provide free and open training that helps increase system security. This can take multiple forms, such as training dedicated security engineers, training developers to write more secure code, training potential contributors to security-focused projects, or training engineers on safer alternatives to technologies they're already using. In this talk we'll describe current and future examples of all the previous use cases, and drill deeper into a case study of how 3mbdeb, a licensed service provider for the coreboot open source firmware project, is contributing to OST2 to advance the state of open source firmware security.</p>

      <p>Vittorio Bertola, from Turin, Italy, born in 1974, engineer, deals with the Internet in all its aspects, including technical, business, social and political matters, as an entrepreneur, writer, activist and software developer.</p>

      <p>He presently works for Open-Xchange, a global leader in free software applications supporting the Internet's infrastructure, where he takes care of research and innovation activities, leading projects to invent and develop new technologies; he also coordinates the company's policy and community activities, showing up in places as varied as the European Parliament and the IETF to argue for an open, safe and decentralized Internet. He is deeply involved in the European Internet industry's efforts to promote interoperability obligations for dominant Internet platforms, forcing them to open up their walled gardens. Previously, he worked as a freelance consultant and as a partner or founder in several small Internet start-ups; he was one of the promoters of Vitaminic, one of the most successful "dot com" companies in Italy, as its Vice President for Technology.</p>

      <p>He deals since the 90's with Internet policies at the national and international level, and is currently a regular attendee at ICANN, at the IETF and in major Internet policy conferences. He was a member of the United Nations' Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG), and one of the inventors of the United Nations Internet Governance Forum (IGF), where he coordinated the civil society caucus and organized the Internet Bill of Rights campaign. He represented the global Internet users in the Board of ICANN, the global policy-making entity for Internet domain names. Over the last twenty years, he has been the promoter of a number of online initiatives, which made him a well known figure on the Italian and global Internet.</p>

    description: |-
      <p>I spent the first part of my working life doing laboratory research in both academia and industry, focusing on drug discovery for cardiovascular disease. In these roles I began to support my peers by building tools and platforms to make certain tasks possible, or easier, using open source technologies. Having enjoyed programming, I embarked on learning more in my spare time using readily available online resources. I eventually moved into tech-based roles where I worked on scientific modeling platforms for startups and public-private partnerships. I spent the last six years as a consultant helping companies with their devops transformation journeys, where I focused on configuration as code, CI/CD pipelines and processes, monitoring and alerting, and how these tools help a team to be better and more confident in operating reliable and scalable infrastructure. I now work as a devops engineer at the Factory a cloud consultancy in the Netherlands.</p>

      <p>I am part of several active open source communities (e.g. puppet, icinga, and Terraform) and have been fortunate enough to have been invited to speak about my experiences in the devops ecosystem and on various technical subjects ranging from scaling Drupal, puppet, icinga and Prometheus. In the last couple of years I have been focusing on how to best integrate the HashiCorp tool stack into my other focus areas including monitoring, scaling, and reliability.</p>

      <p>Dr. Fridtjof Siebert has a long history of implementing compilers, run-time systems and analysis tools for different programming languages on a wide range of platforms. His latest project is the Fuzion language and its open-source implementation.</p>

      <p>In the 90s, he developed the Amiga Oberon compiler as a side-project to finance his studies at the University of Stuttgart. After implementing a compiler for Eiffel on Solaris/SPARC as his diploma thesis, he became part of the Open Software Foundation / The Open Group team in Grenoble that implemented the TurboJ Java compiler.</p>

      <p>During his PhD at the University of Karlsruhe he developed the technical foundation for the JamaicaVM hard-real-time Java implementation. He was founder of the aicas GmbH and served aicas as CTO for 18 years developing their Java technology further to support hard-real-time GC on multi-cores on a large range of real-time OSes and CPU architectures and adding dynamic and static analysis tools such as the VeriFlux static analysis tool for Java byte-code.</p>

      <p>Since 2019, he works as Chief Programming Language Designer for the Tokiwa Software GmbH where he develops the Fuzion language and tools, a new open-source programming language that combines a powerful syntax and safety features with simple base concepts that enable strong static analysis and highly efficient optimizing compilers.</p>

      Today, his major focus lies on holistic security provisions for people in socio-technical
      societies, where isolated approaches to physical and information security are
      no longer useful. His second focus is on the reasons for the still widespread
      use of insecure programming methods &amp; configurations and broken cryptography

      interrelated fields of research on socio-technical systems. He is passionate

      <p>Colin Finck is a German Software Engineer with 15 years of experience in low-level and open-source software development. He joined the ReactOS Project in 2007 to dig deep into Windows internals and held various roles in Kernel &amp; User Mode Development, Release Engineering, System Administration, and Project Management over the years. In 2017, Colin Finck got in touch with the Rust programming language as part of his Master's Thesis. He managed to port the HermitCore Unikernel from C to Rust in a couple of months, with a result that is shorter, easier to maintain, and less prone to bugs. Driven by this success, Colin fully embraced the Rust language, uses it for new projects wherever possible, and encourages you to do the same :)
      His current work attempts to bring the ReactOS and Rust worlds closer together.</p>

      <p>Apart from software development, Colin has also co-founded ReactOS Deutschland e.V. in 2009, a German non-profit organization to support the ReactOS Project legally and financially. He currently serves as one of its Board members.</p>

Sources sold to Sun, reduced, they became Java to such a 1:1 degree that his JavaBridge hybrid object, ObjC on the bottom, Java on top, enabled NeXT to deploy a business sophisticated database backed WebObjects in 1996 and was successful enough to file S3 papers to go public.  Apple bought NeXT instead.
      At Apple, as co-architect of MacOS/Cocoa, for example heintroduced Closures (MacOS 10.6 Snowleopart) and Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) that empowered App explosion.  Blaine is the reason Mac/iOS apps don't pause.
      At ISO/IEC WG14, introduced _Atomic in C11, and was chosen to wrangle all defect fixes into C17.<br/>
      At his California "Social Purpose" (B corp without hassles) Planet Earth Society, his 10 year deep dive into all things Actors and unhackable is, he claims, his best work ever. His version 3 is called TheDew.</p>

      enable.</p>"
    description: |-
      <p>Joining the <a href="https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">CadQuery</a> project in around 2014, Jeremy was graciously allowed by Dave Cowden (CadQuery's creator) to assume the role of lead developer, which Jeremy retained all through the version 1 "era" of CadQuery. More recently, the role of lead developer has been taken on by Adam Urba≈Ñczyk as CadQuery has transitioned away from running within FreeCAD, to using a custom layer built directly on top of the OpenCASCADE CAD kernel. Jeremy is still very involved in the CadQuery ecosystem though, and can often be seen reviewing pull requests and engaging in conversations on GitHub, Discord and Google Groups. Jeremy is responsible for maintaining multiple CadQuery projects that are aimed at making CadQuery easier to run on various operating systems.</p>

      <p>More recently Jeremy has launched <a href="https://semblage.7bindustries.com/en/latest/">Semblage</a>, a project that is designed to bridge the gap between the point-and-click CAD world and the programmatic one. Semblage generates CadQuery code from mouse interactions that is fully compatible with CadQuery IDEs, and could be run in a continuous integration pipeline to generate artifacts, do analysis, simulation and more. Semblage is currently in an alpha state, but Jeremy is able to use it for projects already.</p>

      <p>Jeremy also makes time to use the open source software he contributes to by creating Open Hardware (OSHW/OHW) under the umbrella of <a href="https://7bindustries.com/">7B Industries</a>. Jeremy has an interest in the broader open culture, and can be found hanging out in places like the <a href="https://forum.openhardware.science/">GOSH forum</a> for open science, studying how open source engineering tools are used to create projects like the <a href="https://openflexure.org/projects/microscope/">OpenFlexure</a> open hardware microscope.</p>

      <p>Machine learning models and inferences are being run on the browser and have become very performant. Libraries and frameworks like mediapipe, bodypix have made it easy to integrate ML-based experiences into a WebRTC call with relative ease. We're still in the early days of discovering their possibilities in web applications.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we will walk through how Daily integrated mediapipe in its WebRTC library. We will explore:</p>

      <ol>
      <li>How segmentation models, like the ones used blur backgrounds, work.</li>
      <li>How one can integrate an ML segmentation library (like mediapipe) in a WebRTC video call.</li>
      <li>What other sorts of custom video applications and experiences one can build using a tech stack like these.</li>
      </ol>


      <p>Hopefully, this leaves the audience with ideas for writing custom video processors that might enable the next generation of video experiences on WebRTC.</p>

      <p>We live in an age where each of us has god-like powers at their fingertips.
      Simultaneously, we face many big problems, demanding flexibility and ingenious thinking to resolve.</p>

      <p>The power of technology may be a key in resolving the issues we face, but as with each great power: yielding it comes with a risk. In the case of technology, it is of utmost importance that the platforms, as well as the ways via which information flows, are neutral; no single person or entity must be at the center of those places where we, as society come together and exchange information to collaborate on solving the biggest problems of our age. Decentralized technologies come into play at this point. They are key to realizing the potential of a globally connected humanity.</p>

      <p>Technology is not the only answer. It is equally important to know when not to use technology. To know when to turn of devices and sense the beauty of what is around.</p>

      <p>I approach the world with an open mind and take pleasure in continuously blending my expertise from various domains such as economy, computer science and leading teams together with the ever expanding insight that each new day brings.</p>

      all based on open source tools.</p>"
    description: |-
      <p>Dragan Espenschied, Rhizome‚Äôs lead Digital Conservator and director of the Digital Preservation program, has been involved in several highly visible and influential projects concerning digital conservation and mass curation.</p>

      <p>Since 2011, Espenschied has been restoring and culturally analyzing one terabyte of Geocities data saved by a community effort before its deletion by Yahoo, supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (2012), and the Photographers' Gallery, London (2013).</p>

      <p>From 2012-13, while working at the University of Applied Arts in Karlsruhe, he led on a renowned research project to conceptually and technically integrate the Transmediale Festival's collection of CD-ROM art into the Emulation as a Service framework, developed at the University of Freiburg. In 2013, with the University of Freiburg, Espenschied helped preserve a personal computer from the legacy of media philosopher Vil√©m Flusser, and in 2016, together with computer scientist Klaus Rechert, developed a technical and conceptual framework for exhibiting legacy software art in gallery spaces.</p>

      <p>When starting at Rhizome in 2014, Espenschied commenced to build cloud-based preservation infrastructure unifying web archiving, structured emulation, and linked open data. In Rhizome's 2017-2019 online exhibition program showcasing 100 pieces of online art, <em>Net Art Anthology</em>, Espenschied oversaw and executed preservation efforts on 74 artworks. 2015-2019, Espenschied served as Co-PI on the widely recognized Webrecorder project at Rhizome. 2020 he led on the restoration of <em>TheThing</em>, a 1990's artist BBS system, and the relaunch of Rhizome's ArtBase, a collection of more than 2000 works of born-digital art, as a linked open data system. 2021 he was a founding member of the Wikibase Stakeholder Group.</p>

      <p>In his related artistic career, Espenschied focuses on the historicization of digital culture from the perspective of computer users rather than hackers, developers or "inventors", and together with net art pioneer Olia Lialina, has created a significant body of work concerned with how to represent and write a culture-centric history of the networked age. He has a background as a recording and performing musician including an album release on Aphex Twin‚Äôs renown label Rephlex, and used to be engaged as a net activist in the context of German and EU regulations.</p>

    abstract: <p>Xeno began leading Windows kernel-mode rootkit detection and defense
      research projects at MITRE in 2009, before moving into research on BIOS security
      in 2011. His team's first public talks started appearing in 2013, which led
      to a flurry of presentations on BIOS-level vulnerabilities up through 2014.
      In 2015 he co-founded LegbaCore. And after presenting a firmware worm that could
      spread between Macs via Apple's EFI-based BIOS and Thunderbolt Ethernet adapters,
      he ended up working for Apple. There he worked on securing all the lesser-known
      firmwares on Macs and peripherals - everything from 3rd party GPUs to SecureBoot
      <em>for monitors</em>! He worked on the x86-side of the T2 SecureBoot architecture,
      and his final project was leading the M1 SecureBoot architecture - being directly
      responsible for designing a system that could provide iOS-level security, while
      still allowing customer choice to trust arbitrary non-Apple code such as Linux
      bootloaders. He left Apple in Dec 2020 after the M1 Macs shipped, so he could
      work full time on <a href="OpenSecurityTraining2">https://ost2.fyi</a>.</p>
