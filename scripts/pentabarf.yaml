      <p>Cross cultural teams bring a special set of pitfalls that are not present in mono cultural teams; from hidden misunderstandings to perceived hostility or indifference.   This talk introduces the anthropological concept of cultural relativism, explores how it can be used to uncover potential conflicts that arise out of cultural differences, and presents culturally sensitive strategies for addressing them.</p>

      <p>You will gain an understanding of the interplay between culture and perception, and will understand how to apply the prism of cultural relativism to detect, understand, and disarm cultural differences that lead to failure within cross cultural communities.</p>

      <p>When kids learn to program they often use either a visual language like Scratch, or a textual language like Python. While visual languages are great for the first steps, children and educators often want to move on to a textual language. However early on, a textual language and its error messages can be scary and frustrating.</p>

      <p>Hedy aims bridge this gap with a programming language that is gradual, using different language levels. In level 1, there is hardly any syntax at all; printing is done with: print hello! At every level, new syntax and concepts are added, so learners do not have to master everything at once. Hedy builds up to a subset of Python including conditions, loops, variables and lists.</p>

      <p>To make learning as accessible as possible, Hedy allows for the use of localized keywords, f.e in Spanish:</p>

      <p>imprimir Hello!</p>

      <p>This talk will discuss the pedagogy of Hedy as well as its technical aspects, since a set of changing and localized complex grammars poses several interesting challenges for parsing, and a small language offers a lot of potential from improved error messages.</p>

      <p>A 2021 Tidelift survey of 400 open source maintainers found that 46% of maintainers are not paid at all, and only 26% earn more than $1,000 per year for maintenance work. Over half (59%) have quit or considered quitting maintaining a project, and almost half of respondents listed lack of financial compensation as their top reason for disliking being a maintainer.</p>

      <p>Beyond the projects maintained by the proverbial single individual in Nebraska in their free time narrative, there are other reasons for projects "going bad". I'd like to share some stories, straight from the horse's mouth, share some of the give-aways of unhealthy projects, and together find ways for mitigation.</p>

      <p>Nix, and by extension NixOS, are incredible tools to define infrastructures and deployments of dedicated machines. Unfortunately, sometimes the load is too big for even an optimized network stack and we need to get dedicated equipment such as load balancers to handle the load.

      <p>Nix, and by extension NixOS, are incredible tools to define infrastructures and deployments of dedicated machines. Unfortunately, sometimes the load is too big for even an optimized network stack and we need to get dedicated equipment such as load balancers to handle the load. What if we could configure those from within Nix?</p>

      <p>P4, a Domain Specific Language intended to produce highly optimized network processing code, allows for that. It can produce code that can be synthesized to FPGAs or even configure network ASICs in order to have optimized solutions to those problems.</p>

      <p>Maintaining an open source project is hard work that often extends out over several years, and maintainer burnout is common within open source projects. It can be hard for already overworked maintainers to balance the day to day work required to keep the project running while also investing in additional activity to increase future community sustainability. This includes getting help with all of the different types of contributions required to make an open source project successful: documentation, marketing, community management, and so much more. The good news is that we have best practices, resources, guides, and templates available to make it easier for maintainers and projects to build a contributor strategy that leads to a strong and growing community for an open source project over the long term. This talk will help you apply those resources in your project.</p>

      <p>This talk will have several major sections. 1) Discussion about the major factors that impact contributor growth. 2) Developing and executing on a long-term contributor growth strategy, including governance, new contributor onboarding, and mentoring. 3) Using contributor ladders to promote contributors into leadership positions as more maintainers to share the workload can reduce maintainer burnout over time. 4) Metrics for measuring project sustainability.</p>

      <p>It is difficult to plan a such evolution, as Debian is large, the staff of administrators is small and busy, and covering all the translation subprojects is a very challenge.</p>

      <p>On the debian-facile wiki page, I suggest a way in order to ensure the new translator walks at his/her owh rhythm, meets the team, understands the process, and so on. Of course, we need support, help and persons, but at least it lets persons not using modern tools to contribute and, if they want, become a Debian Developer not uploading.</p>

      <p>CI/CD the GitOps way, involves automatically shipping your code from your local machine to the intended server, it could be a UAT or production environment. This is usually achieved through toolsets like source control provider  (Gitlab/GitHub), CI tool (Jenkins/Github Action),  Kubernetes Orchestrators among others. FluxCD is an Open-source tool that recently joined CNCF  family. FluxCD treats Git as the source of truth and ensures desired synchronisation is done with the intended cluster.

      <p>Do you document your code?
      Imagine that you need to get back to your code in 6 month after you wrote it, there is always a big possibility that you will have to spend some time to find out how this code works. Or if someone else wrote some code, which is already in production and your task is to fix a bug in it and there is no documentation and no one actually knows what this code does.</p>

      <p>There are more benefits of implementing continuous documentation for the code:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>easy to onboard new team members,</li>
      <li>easy to share knowledge,</li>
      <li>if this code is open source - easy to start contributing,</li>
      <li>easy to see purpose and motivation of each piece of code,</li>
      <li>easy to keep versioning for each new release of the code.</li>

      <li>easy to share knowledge,</li>
      <li>if this code is open source - easy to start contributing,</li>
      <li>easy to see purpose and motivation of each piece of code,</li>
      <li>easy to keep versioning for each new release of the code.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>It this talk I will show the difference between documentation types and will show a demo in the end of the talk.</p>

      <p>Gallia is an extendable pentesting framework with the focus on the automotive domain.
      The scope of the toolchain is conducting penetration tests from a single ECU up to whole cars.
      Currently, the main focus lies on the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/72439.html">UDS</a> interface.
      Acting as a generic interface, the logging functionality implements reproducible tests and enables post-processing tasks.

      Especially after releasing support of the Language Server Protocol(LSP), which works as a client to LSP servers for example rust-analyzer.

But then something happens: when Zangemann wants to take another close-up look at his inventions during a walk through the city, a child hits him in the shin with the skateboard. That hurts! Enraged, the inventor makes a momentous decision... The clever girl Ada sees through what is going on. Together with her friends, she forges a plan.</p>

      <p>This illustrated children's book (licensed under Creative Commons BY-SA) tells the story of the famous inventor Zangemann and the girl Ada, a curious tinkerer. Ada begins to experiment with hardware and software, and in the process realizes how crucial it is for her and others to control technology. Ada &amp; Zangemann will inspire children's interest in tinkering and encourages shaping technology.</p>

      <p>The famous inventor Zangemann lives in a huge villa high above the city. Adults and children alike love his inventions and are desperate to have them. But then something happens: when Zangemann wants to take another close-up look at his inventions during a walk through the city, a child hits him in the shin with the skateboard. That hurts! Enraged, the inventor makes a momentous decision... The clever girl Ada sees through what is going on. Together with her friends, she forges a plan.</p>

      <p>This illustrated children's book (licensed under Creative Commons BY-SA) tells the story of the famous inventor Zangemann and the girl Ada, a curious tinkerer. Ada begins to experiment with hardware and software, and in the process realizes how crucial it is for her and others to control technology. Ada &amp; Zangemann will inspire children's interest in tinkering and encourages shaping technology.</p>

      <p>Unikernels aims at improving the way single purpose systems are built with minimalist kernels that the user‚Äôs application compiles within. This results in deployments that require less memory, less disk, less cpu and less time to be up and running. Also, the whole system spends most of the time in the user application or doing IO for that single application thus cpu time is used more efficiently. In this presentation, we talk about the use of unikernels for High Performance Computing. We present a work-in-progress that aims at implementing the MPI standard on top of Toro, an open-source non-POSIX unikernel. In this work, we implement a library that conforms to the Open MPI implementation. This library relies on Toro API to implement the MPI functions. In particular, the library leverages Toro‚Äôs features like per-CPU memory allocation, cooperative scheduler, thread migration and inter-core communication based on Virtio. During the initialization, Toro creates one instance of the MPI application per core. Each instance is a thread that is migrated to the corresponding core and then executes without any interference. When applications are required to allocate memory, each core has its own memory pool from where memory is allocated. This allows us to keep memory allocation local, thus improving the way cache is used. Also, primitives like MPI<em>Gather() or MPI</em>Scatter() that require communication between instances are implemented by relying on a new Virtio device named virtio-bus that allows core-to-core communication without locking. At the moment, we have implemented the following APIs:
      - MPI<em>Gather()
      - MPI</em>Scatter()
      - MPI<em>Reduce()
      - MPI</em>Barrier()
      The goal of this PoC is to port benchmarks from the osu-microbenchmarking (http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/benchmarks/) to compare with existing implementations. During the presentation, we present how this is implemented and we demonstrate the use of the current implementation by executing different MPI applications on top of Toro.</p>

This talk is about my journey to provide a fully-featured DNS service for my personal domains, using PowerDNS Authoritative Server, at very low cost and without subscribing to any 'big tech' services where I would be the product and not the customer!</p>

      <p>In my case, fully-featured includes DNSSEC with online signing, DNS UPDATE (RFC 2136) support (primarily used for ACME DNS-01 challenges for Let's Encrypt certificates), SVCB/HTTPS records, and more. The talk will also cover the way that I use Ansible to manage zones and their content in the authoritative servers, using Ansible modules I created and published. As a bonus, I'll also talk about how I manage recursive resolvers on my LANs with the ability to resolve names from my own domains even if Internet connectivity is lost, and with nearly immediate updates when the zone contents are changed.</p>

      <p>Podcasting has been around for 20 years.
      Many revolutions have happened since then: DSL connections, smartphones, social networks, artificial intelligence everywhere‚Ä¶ But Podcasting stayed still and its decentralized architecture resisted to the big corporations.
      In this talk we will show how the Podcasting 2.0 community is reinventing Podcasting by adding tons of new features, while keeping all this interoperable.
      We will quickly demonstrate how this actually works with Castopod, an open-source podcast hosting solution.</p>

    description: |-
      <p>I wanted the security of Signal Private Messenger together with the convenience of Facebook.  So I created an app called Circles that uses Matrix as its server.  All posts are end-to-end encrypted, so even the server admins can't read what users post or look at their pictures.</p>

      <p>In Matrix, everything happens in a room.  So Circles uses Matrix rooms to store all of its posts.  We use Matrix rooms in two different ways to let users connect and share in an organic way.</p>

      <p>First, we can use a Matrix room to store one individual user's own posts, similar to their "wall" in Facebook.  The user can invite other users to follow them by joining the room.  Followers can also post emoji reactions and replies to the room owner's posts.  In the app, a social "circle" consists of one such "wall" room belonging to the current user, plus similar "wall" rooms belonging to the user's friends.  For example, Alice's "Friends" circle might consist of her own "Friends" room, her buddy Bob's "Friends" room, and their friend Carol's "Friends" room.  The app hides most of the complexity of the multiple rooms and instead presents the user with a single unified timeline of posts collated from all the rooms in the circle.</p>

      <p>Second, we can use a single Matrix room to represent a social group (like a Facebook group) where everyone in the group knows each other.  All that is required here is to render Matrix messages as a timeline of "social" posts rather than as chat messages.</p>

      <p>We estimate that building on Matrix saved us 18-24 months of development time for our first minimum viable prototype.  Overall the experience has been very good.</p>

      <p>However, we did run into a few pain points.  These include:</p>

      <ol>
      <li>Decryption errors with the iOS SDK</li>
      <li>Needing two passphrases to enable secure server-side storage, or hoping that the user never loses their first device</li>
      <li>Problems with the 3rd party identity server that we initially used for email verification</li>
      <li>No ability to post both text and media in the same message</li>
      <li>No ability to give a new user access to the earliest encrypted posts in the room</li>
      <li>Questions about server performance and scalability</li>
      </ol>


      <p>To address #2 and #3, we built a new authentication service using the Matrix user-interactive authentication API.</p>

      <p>We are looking forward to upcoming improvements in the Matrix spec, including extensible events, rooms as profiles, and sliding sync.</p>

I share my experience at building large production platforms at Microsoft, VMware, Twilio and GitHub and how I believe that fixing the layer "below" Kubernetes will unlock better higher order systems in the future.</p>

      <p>The audience walks away with an in-depth understanding of the current state of affairs with eBPF, cgroups, gRPC and mTLS with Rust. We learn where the Rust community is "up to par" and where we have some improvements to make. We also explore why I originally prototyped Aurae in Go and then made the decision to move full time to Rust for the project.</p>

      <p>Aurae takes ownership of all runtime processes on a single piece of hardware like systemd, and provides mTLS encrypted gRPC APIs (Aurae Standard Library) to manage the processes. Aurae has a new style of isolation called "Aurae Cells" that manage cgroups and namespaces directly from pid1. With Aurae Cells the project offers a way to slice up a system using various isolation strategies for enterprise workloads including MicroVMs.</p>

      <p>Learn about 3 specific parts of the project and how they influenced the decision to move to Rust.</p>

      <li>Managing cgroups (v1/v2) directly with Rust, and how kata containers and systemd influenced the container runtime module.</li>
      <li>mTLS encrypted gRPC with tonic and rustls. Learn why I have given up on OpenSSL and where rustls is working well and not so well for us.</li>
      <li>Serving ephemeral short lived microVMs with Aurae, and how we "spawn" a new host and kernel into a microVM that shares properties with the parent instance of Aurae.</li>

    raw_description: "<p>Drink is written in Elixir and makes use of several Elixir
      strengths, notably the parallelism, which is very important for a DNS server.
      Also, writing an Internet server means dealing with broken (or downright hostile)
      clients so robustness is important. We will discuss the technical decisions,
      their consequences, and the remaining problems.</p>"

      <p>Spoiler alert: it's a clickbait title, I'm not really a rockstar! :-)</p>

      <p>That said, it's usually not that well known, but Linux has an amazing ecosystem for creating music, whatever genre you like, with a ton of fantastic applications to tackle different stages of the music production. In this presentation, I'll share what my experience has been in this past couple of years, talking about the different applications I've used to compose, orchestrate, process, mix, master and so on, with real or virtual instruments, and how that allowed me to publish a few albums just for the fun of it.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The music production ecosystem on Linux is huge, and yet it's unortunately not that well known, possibly because it's seen more as "just" software for entertainment purposes rather than something much more serious and valuable than that. JACK and, more recently, Pipewire provide an excellent environment for working with low latency music, and there's a ton of applications that can help at different stages of music production. There's software for composing and/or orchestrating your music, using music sheets, piano rolls or patterns; software for processing your real instruments and software for simulating virtual instruments, including complex syntethizers; DAWs to work on music projects in a more organized way; a plethora of plugins that can be used in different applications to customize the way each track needs to be processed, and mix/master your work; and so on and so forth. And while I mostly like working on "rock" and orchestral music (and so the talk will focus a bit more on software that helped me do that), there's so much software out there to help with basically any genre that you may be interested in, from classical music to dub and beyond.</p>

      <p>I'll also talk a bit of the community aspects of it (for instance introducing the LinuxMusicians forum or the "Made with Ardour" topic that allowed me to meet so many other people using FOSS to create and share their music), and share a few notes about how you can indeed share your music with the world (or at least how I did it!).</p>

In addition, virtual events do not need to be limited to tutorial-type sessions, but they can also be used to provide additional opportunities for community members to get together, network, and collaborate (e.g., for triaging issues, working on documentation, etc.). Even as life returns to normal, virtual events should remain an important tool‚Äìand complement what we‚Äôre doing with in-person events‚Äìfor helping open-source communities grow.</p>

      systems that not only speak your language, but also the languages of your users.
      To do that, we're redefining how localisation really works, and building a system
      that's interoperable with all existing data formats, workflows and processes,
      as well as (hopefully!) all the ones we can't even imagine yet. Let me show
      you this new world, and where it might lead us.</p>"

      <p>Just as we need the ability to prove real-world identity, so will the need arise in the digital domain as the offline world slowly merges with the online world. But this time, let's improve on the concept and give people full sovereignty over their identity.</p>

      <p>Keyoxide is a new decentralized tool to verify online identities using modern cryptography through a system of claims and proofs. People use it to establish a verifiable digital passport that links to all their online accounts. These passports can even be anonymous.</p>

      <p>This talk briefly introduces the concept of online identity and explains how Keyoxide went about solving it in a decentralized way, using established cryptography standards and infrastructure, without needing blockchain-related technologies.</p>

      people designing 32-bit linux products/systems still likely to be in use then
      have long product cycles so fixing this has become quite urgent. The base work
      has been done, but how to manage this ABI transition in distro-world needs some

      <p>The fundamental choice is whether to treat it is a new arch/ABI/triplet or to migrate within the existing 32-bit arches/triplets to the new ABI. If different distros take different paths here we could end up in very confusing place. Updating ABIs has happened before so it is possible, but time_t appears in a lot of places and such a migration is certainly tricky. It may not be practical for some binary distros. Rebuilding from scratch is simpler but definitely requires a new GNU triplet.</p>

      <p>Various people have looked into this over the last 3 years, but no one person has a good overview. Exactly how difficult this transition is still needs some experimentation and research. FOSDEM is a good opportunity to see where we are at, and see if we are agreed on a way forward.</p>

      <p>Passwordless authentication is making a lot noise. Use of FIDO2/WebAuthn tokens and other passwordless means to login to web services is all the rage but there isn't that much available to make the technology usable without troubles for 'traditional' Linux systems, locally and remotely.</p>

      <p>For past several years FreeIPA and SSSD teams have been working on enabling end to end passwordless access in centralized and local environment, be it corporate or home deployment. This talk will go into details of our progress in passwordless access implementation for Linux systems.</p>

      <p>In 2022 FreeIPA project introduced ability to authenticate users against OAuth2 identity providers (IdPs). This functionality allows to obtain Kerberos credentials after authentication and authorization has been done by the external IdP. As many OAuth2 IdPs allow passwordless authentication with WebAuthn tokens, a true passwordless transition across Linux systems is now available, from login to console, raising privileges within PAM services (e.g. sudo access), to accessing remote systems over SSH. We hope to expand this support with native FIDO2/WebAuthn integration as well.</p>

      <p>The work is not complete yet and needs a lot of collaboration across multiple open source projects. Come to this talk to see a demo and discuss how we can improve our passwordless experience together.</p>

      <p>Matlab + Simulink is a very powerful tool. This tool allows engineers to simulate real devices. In open sources, some tools exist, such as Scilab + Xcos.
      With the growing community of Python, some tools appeared: NumPy, SciPy... Those tools intend to propose a Matlab alternative environment equivalent for Python.
      MuPhyN is an interface that is intended to reproduce the Simulink capabilities. The goal is to produce a community-based simulation software.</p>

      <p>It is based on a Qt interface and uses a simulator core. It is fully written in Python and uses YAML as the descriptive language. The library feature proposed allows users to add as many boxes and schedulers as they want.
      The already created boxes take advantage on the SciPy and NumPy libraries to produce their behaviors.</p>

      <p>Scaling your object store is complex and payloads vary in size - objects can be as large as virtual machine images or
      as small as emails. In behaviour - some are mostly reading, writing, and listing objects. Other payloads delete
      objects, and some keep them forever. Using CPU and RAM to autoscale the pods horizontally or vertically is limited
      and may adversely affect the system. Treating our object store as a queueing system: converting HTTP
      requests to actions on disks may be the solution!</p>
    description: |-
      <p>In this talk, we would show how we use KEDA and Prometheus to track the backlog of work in an object store system
      orchestrated by Rook and to autoscale the object store pods based on different metrics. We show how autoscaling is
      impacting the performance and resource utilization in the environment by taking Ceph‚Äôs object store frontend (the
      RADOS Gateway daemon) as a use case.
      We will demonstrate how to use KEDA and Prometheus to solve a scaling problem that cannot be quickly resolved by
      the traditional HPA (horizontal pod autoscaling). We will show how the Rook operator orchestrates the different
      parts of the system. Attendees will learn how to use cloud-native tools to perform autoscaling, better utilize
      resources like CPU and I/O and increase the performance of their solutions.</p>

      <p>An instant world requires instant decisions at scale. This includes the ability to digest and react to changes in real-time. Thus, event logs such as Apache Kafka can be found in almost every architecture, while databases and similar systems still provide the foundation. Change Data Capture (CDC) has become popular for propagating changes. Nevertheless, integrating all these systems, which often have slightly different semantics, can be a challenge.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we highlight what it means for Apache Flink to be a general data processor that acts as a data integration hub. Looking under the hood, we demonstrate Flink's SQL engine as a changelog processor that ships with an ecosystem tailored to processing CDC data and maintaining materialized views. We will discuss the semantics of different data sources and how to perform joins or stream enrichment between them. This talk illustrates how Flink can be used with systems such as Kafka (for upsert logging), Debezium, JDBC, and others.</p>

      <p>Kaitai Struct is a tool for parsing binary formats. Binary formats, such as archive files, executables, filesystems, multimedia files, network protocols, etc. are everywhere. If your application needs to read data in a specific binary format, you need a parser that unpacks the bytes into meaningful data structures that you can work with. There are libraries doing that for popular formats, but what if there is no suitable library in your programming language for the format you need?</p>

      <p>Kaitai Struct has got you covered: it introduces a declarative domain-specific language (based on YAML) for describing the structure of arbitrary binary formats. Format specifications in this language are consumed by a compiler, which generates ready-to-use parsing modules in 11 programming languages (C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Lua, Nim, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby). There are more than 180 format specifications in the format gallery and hundreds more in various GitHub projects.</p>

      <p>This talk will discuss the current state, capabilities and limitations of Kaitai Struct. It will also focus on serialization: a highly requested feature that is being actively worked on. Currently, Kaitai Struct can only parse (read) existing binary files created by other applications. Serialization allows to edit the data of an existing file and write it back or create a new file from scratch, greatly expanding the use of all written format specifications.</p>

      <p>The tools necessary for 3D printing, CAM and CNC, and other maker-based activities are available to run instantly in the browser with no software to install. This is ideal for STEAM education, online coursework, maker spaces, or anywhere you either can't install software or can't keep it up to date.</p>

      <p>Modern browsers expose substantial computational power with access to multiple cores, shared memory, GPUs, and near-native code execution with Web Assembly. It is possible to present complete browser-based replacements for applications that were previously only the domain of desktop-installed software. Add in the capabilities of Progressive Web Apps, we get always-on, always up-to-date applications that start instantly and have a fraction of the footprint of their desktop counterparts.</p>

      <p>The focus of this talk, Kiri:Moto, was started in late 2013 as a 3D printing slicer when the cohort of available tools was very limited. It has since evolved to handle 4-axis CAM, laser cutters, and mSLA output targets. Kiri:Moto was one of the first slicers to support belt 3D printers. And this cutting-edge work will soon extend to 5 axis FDM.</p>

      <p>Kiri:Moto runs both online and offline (as a progressive web app) in standard browsers as well as mobile devices and tablets. It pushes the boundaries of what's possible inside the browser sandbox using web workers for distributed computing, WASM for accelerated computation, and ThreeJS for visualization.</p>

      <p>The active base of users skews toward college and high-school classrooms, maker-spaces, and individual creators. It is available (also free) inside of Onshape's web-based CAD, helping to make a complete in-browsers stack requiring no software installation to go from design to manufacture.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we will present some inspiring success stories from the campaign around Europe and invite you to follow their example. For this we will explain how the campaign framework can be used to push for the adoption of Free Software friendly policies in your area; be it your public administration, your library, your university, your city, your region, or your country.</p>

Together we contacted politicians, decision makers, and civil servants on all levels -- from the European Union and national governments, to city mayors and the heads of public libraries about this demand. This did not just lead to important discussions about software freedom with decision makers, but also already to specific policy changes.

      <p>In this talk, we will introduce td-shim (https://github.com/confidential-containers/td-shim).
      Td-shim is a lightweight Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) virtual firmware (TDVF) for the simplified kernel for TD based confidential container (e.g. Kubernetes).
      In order to match the short start-up time and resource consumption overhead of bare-metal containers, runtime architectures for TD-based containers put a strong focus on minimizing boot time. They must also launch the container payload as quickly as possible. Hardware virtualization-based containers typically run on top of simplified and customized Linux kernels to minimize the overall guest boot time. As such, we introduced the td-shim to replace the traditional Open Virtual Machine Firmware (OVMF) based TDVF for container use case.
      Currently the rust-based td-shim supports multiple hypervisors such as KVM and cloud hypervisor with smaller size and better boot performance. It provides a secure and efficient way of building the cloud native infrastructure.</p>

      <p>With Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) capable of teraflop performance
      double digit speedups over single core execution are possible.
      An alternative application of GPU acceleration is quality up:
      if we can afford to wait the same amount of time as on a single core,
      then how much more accurately can we compute the same result?
      A multiple double is an unevaluated sum of doubles and multiple double
      arithmetic exploits the optimized hardware for floating-point arithmetic,
      with predictable overhead and simple memory management.</p>

      <p>The talk will present experiences with software package QDlib

      (Joldes, Muller, Popescu, Tucker, 2016) on NVIDIA GPUs,
      in particular the P100, V100, and RTX 2080.

      <p>FOSSbot is a 3D-printed educational robot that uses open software, open design and electronics, and can be employed in all levels of education. FOSSBot has been developed collaboratively by Harokopio University of Athens and the Greek Free and Open Source Software (GFOSS) community. The use of FOSSBOT in education will be supported by collaborative seminars for all teachers of all specialties and levels based on educational material developed at https://elearn.ellak.gr. The aim of the action is to familiarize teachers with modern education models based on the S.T.E.A.M approach. (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics) and establish a student-centered approach to knowledge, based on open technologies, in order to lay the foundations for the creation of an open environment of discovery learning that will creatively contribute to the transformation of students into active citizens.</p>

      <p>FOSSBot belongs to the DIY (Do It Yourself) category, with the logic that it can easily be built by other people besides its creators, and its disassembly and reassembly process can be part of an educational process in the classroom. This is possible since FOSSBot is made of electronic materials that can be easily found commercially at a low cost while the plastic parts are printable.</p>

      <p>FOSSbot is a free and open source and open design 3D printed robot that can be used in education. It belongs to the DIY (Do It Yourself) category, with the logic that it can easily be built by other people besides its creators, and its disassembly and reassembly process can be part of an educational process in the classroom. This is possible since FOSSBot is made of electronic materials that can be easily found commercially at a low cost while the plastic parts are printable.
      It provides four main operation modes: i) a UI with buttons that is suitable for preschool children and shows the main capabilities of the robot, for example moving the robot forward or backward, or turning clockwise and anti-clockwise, ii) a block-based graphical programming interface (based on Google Blockly) aimed at primary school students, iii) a notebook coding interface that can be used for teaching high school students and elementary school students the fundamentals of Python programming (such as loops, conditions, events, etc.), iv) a Python coding mode, which allows to directly work into the FOSSBot programming shell and gives direct control to the low-level electronics.</p>

      <p>The software of FOSSbot is based on a modular stack that allows the implementation the various programming functions, orchestrates everything through the UI, and controls the hardware in an easy way through a software library that plays the role of the FOSSBot operating system. This stack includes Google Blockly, Python Jupyter, Python Flask which hosts FOSSBot's UI, the core FOSSBot library written in Python which controls the bot's hardware, and finally the manual operation it offers to users through a user interface, i.e. a way to control the robot without any programming knowledge.
      FOSSBot's software is built using the latest versions of the above technologies, including Docker, continuous integration, and microservices integration (CI) logic. As mentioned in the introduction, programming the robot can be done in different ways which are followed and analyzed.</p>

      <p>The hardware is based on a Raspberry-Pi zero that controls everything and a set of electronics comprising:
      - Sensors: Ultrasonic distance sensor, Battery Sensor, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Odometers, IR Receiver, Line detection sensors, Light Sensors
      - Interaction Features: Speaker and Front RGB LED
      - General Features: Brick-compatible surface, Hole in the front for attaching a marker/pencil, a special pulling loop, rechargeable batteries</p>

      <p>All the plastic parts, except the wheels, are printable on a 3D printer and the total printing time does not exceed 36 hours. It is worth mentioning that the body of the robot has been designed in such a way as to facilitate its assembly process. This has been achieved since cases have been designed inside the robot, and adapted to the electronic components so that they are placed in the corresponding positions and do not move during the use of the robot. Also, on the outer surface, there are printed symbols that indicate the position of each sensor. The symbols also help teachers to know the position of the sensors, e.g. speaker, led, etc. The vertical tube that runs from top to bottom of the main body of the robot allows for the attachment of a pencil or marker so that by moving the FOSSBot around an area covered with paper, shapes can be created.
      Printed meshes on the front and top of the robot help keep electrical parts cool. The robot's charging port, on/off switch, and a unique loop for towing small items are all located on the back. The loop also serves to protect the robot from minor collisions. Two printed spoilers above the wheels add to wheel protection and to the robot's aesthetic design.
      The top surface of the robot is divided into two pieces. A cover that attaches to the main body using unique clips is the original accessory. The main cover can be joined to the top cover using an easy twist-and-lock function. It can be easily removed to give access to the interior of the robot and can also support a base of plastic bricks, allowing bricks to be added on top of the robot. This option enables lower-grade teachers to combine FOSSBot with other projects and can help add new activities to FOSSBot.</p>

      <p>StackRox integrates with every stage of the container lifecycle: build, deploy, and runtime. It has the ability to monitor, scan, and prevent the execution of vulnerable code, and container images in multiple and almost any flavor of your Kubernetes clusters that too from a single control plane. It plays a huge role in its supply chain security pattern by providing continuous scanning via CI/CD pipelines and integration with image registries so that vulnerable and misconfigured container images could be remediated within the same developer environment, with real-time feedback and alerts.</p>

      <p>At the end of this session, users will have a fair knowledge on:
      - How StackRox in a cloud-native way could help to observe, analyze and react on 1:N Kubernetes clusters with minimal human efforts (1: Control Plane, N: Secured Kubernetes Clusters)
      - How teams could reduce operational overhead and streamline security practices in large-scale environments.</p>

      - How to ensure the code is being delivered through secured infrastructure?
      - How one could proactively detect the vulnerabilities and secure the components as soon as they are affected?</p>

      <p>The intent of this session is to address these concerns and this would also emphasize on:
      - How StackRox helps to shift left the security efforts for developers and security teams
      - Glimpse of an Admission Controller detecting policy violations caused by insecure workloads
      - Significance of eBPF nodes
      - The DevSecOps model &amp; supply chain security practices.

      <p>At NLnet Labs, we worked on creating an API and prototype implementation for 'connectbyname', library function that takes as input a (DNS) name and returns a TLS connection. The idea is to work towards a standard API for such a function, that can internally use asynchronous DNS lookups, implement Happy Eyeballs, support DANE, SVCB/HTTPS, encrypted client hello, etc. I will present the various prototype implementation we created.</p>

      <p>During this work we found that supporting the many new DNS connection types (DNS
       over TLS, DNS over HTTPS, DNS over QUIC) from within a library is creating a nu
      mber of problems. To deal with this problem, we created a new EDNS(0) option called Proxy Control option, that allows stub resolvers to send requirements to a local proxy. I will present this option and how it can help to keep DNS stub resolvers simple.</p>

      <p>When discussing contributions, we still see a lot of emphasis on the code contributions into project repositories. But the open source world is extensive and diverse, and everyone can find their place there. Your project will benefit from various experiences that non-coders can bring to the table. Isn‚Äôt that cool when you receive an issue with an interesting bug from the community, read about a user case in a blog or a review, or someone makes a video guide for your product? And more!</p>

      <p>In this talk, we will look into different types of non-code contributions to the open source project. We will discuss how they can provide value to your project and team, and how to invite, engage and empower non-code contributors. We will cover various ways to find and measure those contributions and recognize individuals based on the experience that Percona Community Team gained working with non-code contributions to Percona repositories.</p>

      <p>Cryptography is undergoing a renaissance and explosion in algorithms that open up entirely new design spaces. Techniques such as zero-knowledge snarks, multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption allow us to create software that just 5 years ago was unimaginable. This unlocks a new field that we term anonymous engineering.</p>

      <p>This talk will briefly explain how they work from a high level mathematical overview, present the abstraction they provide and show how they can be composed into applications. We will also show demos of writing ZK proofs and deploying them in our software.</p>

      <p>The original designers of UNIX in the 80s had a vision of computing which would allow groups of people to collaborate. From that vision was born the modern conceptualisations of networking, multi-user accounts, filesystems and multi-process OS. But they were limited at the time by the computer resources available, the network bandwidth and the algorithms. Since then the paradigm of computing has remained largely stagnant.</p>

      <p>Also the Linux world after many setbacks is doing soulsearching and trying to understand what made us truly unique, getting back to first principles and our original values. We believe the time is ripe for the grand mission of reinventing the paradigm of computing. Recent developments in p2p &amp; consensus algorithms, and crypto algorithms in particular ZK lay the groundwork for us to extend the original vision of the UNIX creators much further. Our wish is to draw the attention of the free software community to these magical and important developments.</p>

      <p>As an example, we want to also present the software stack that we are creating. Our team at DarkFi has created:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Anonymous transfers</li>
      <li>Anonymous exchange</li>
      <li>Anonymous DAO (treasury management where participants have voting rights)</li>
      <li>Encrypted task manager</li>
      <li>Anonymous chat software with spam protection (no registration, uses ZK proofs)</li>
      </ul>


      <p>All of this software is p2p and censorship resistant. We will explain other potential software designs such as authentication of information, anonymous auctions, proof of reserves, private statistical processing of info, and more.</p>

      <p>The original designers of UNIX in the 80s had a vision of computing which would allow groups of people to collaborate. From that vision was born the modern conceptualisations of networking, multi-user accounts, filesystems and multi-process OS. But they were limited at the time by the computer resources available, the network bandwidth and the algorithms. Since then the paradigm of computing has remained largely stagnant.</p>

      <p>Also the Linux world after many setbacks is doing soulsearching and trying to understand what made us truly unique, getting back to first principles and our original values. We believe the time is ripe for the grand mission of reinventing the paradigm of computing. Recent developments in p2p &amp; consensus algorithms, and crypto algorithms in particular ZK lay the groundwork for us to extend the original vision of the UNIX creators much further. Our wish is to draw the attention of the free software community to these magical and important developments.</p>

      <p>As an example, we want to also present the software stack that we are creating. Our team at DarkFi has created:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Anonymous transfers</li>
      <li>Anonymous exchange</li>
      <li>Anonymous DAO (treasury management where participants have voting rights)</li>
      <li>Encrypted task manager</li>
      <li>Anonymous chat software with spam protection (no registration, uses ZK proofs)</li>
      </ul>


      <p>All of this software is p2p and censorship resistant. We will explain other potential software designs such as authentication of information, anonymous auctions, proof of reserves, private statistical processing of info, and more.</p>

      <p>Intro: Our CHAOSS DEI reflection team is amazing. We have been able to work together over the last few years, building and establishing direction for the CHAOSS project and others. Our work has resulted in many improvements within the CHAOSS project as well as external engagements aimed at better centering DEI within open source.</p>

      <p>Main idea 1: Supporting new contributors and making your onboarding process smooth helps with contributor retention.</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>Supporting detail 1: Challenges include language barriers, time zones, access to tools from bandwidth limitations or other access limitations, merging in and accepting contributions in a timely manner</p></li>
      <li><p>Supporting detail 2: Helpful strategies include improving documentation, open office hours, welcome slackbot, accepting contributions of all kinds, having a newcomer space in slack/communication channels, onboarding calls</p></li>
      </ul>


      <p>Main idea 2: Our two-year reflection process did not always go as planned.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Supporting detail 1: Building newcomer experiences has been challenging. The CHAOSS global community has grown tremendously, for example, the African chapter has grown to over 180 members in the last few months‚Äì and as such, newcomer onboarding and paths to contribution became a priority for us. Our expectation was to make a difference and directly assist newcomers in CHAOSS since many of us  can relate to their pain of getting overwhelmed by the many parts in CHAOSS. It is  true that we made a significant impact; however, we had to reevaluate our first plan and improve on it. For example, office hours didn't get as much attention as we would have liked, so we adjusted the time and cadence, then went one step further with documentation diversity for newcomers (specifically the teams' sheet and quickstart for newcomers). More recently, we started a strategy document for newcomers' onboarding and have kickstarted newcomer onboarding calls.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Main idea 3: Strategic use of community surveys helps you to better understand the feelings, emotion, and qualitative feedback of the community.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Supporting detail 1: Make sure the community survey is completely anonymous and no personal information will be collected, and is GDPR compliant. Access to data should be limited and only report aggregated data on a high level. Have clear goals for what you want to learn more about, but be open to organic community response. Also consider troll-ish responses, and follow set standards when asking about demographic data.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Conclusion: We have learned to be patient with our work. Advancing DEI in open source is challenging as we attend to corporate interests, community needs, and, most importantly, the safety of people for whom our efforts have an impact.</p>

      <p>We have a rich and evolving set of standards that we use to build and deploy interoperable systems. We also have a talented and productive open source community that creates code intended for use in these systems and their ongoing operation. The challenge is shifting from defining standards and writing code to knowing which standards to use and finding code that accelerates implementation and deployment of these standards. This challenge increases as we become more efficient at defining new standards and creating new open source projects.
      What if we could make it easier to navigate this landscape? What if we could create clear links between standards and code? This would  make our open source and  standards communities more productive. It would also make the great work they do more useful and rewarding. Fortunately, a set of practices is being defined and put in practice to make make it easy to identify and find open source code related to IETF standards.

      <p>Wildfires, flood, severe windstorms and heatwaves are just a few of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù emergencies that have become more frequent in the European Union. While we‚Äôre used to preparing for major disasters - earthquakes, cyclones - it‚Äôs time to start thinking about how good maps can save lives and help us navigate better these increasingly common events.</p>

      <p>With a view to preparedness and disaster reduction, we‚Äôll take a look at features worth mapping in OpenStreetMap -- parking lots, vacant businesses, gas stations, ad hoc "cooling centers" -- that you might otherwise overlook and give a short overview of tools like Mapillary and StreetComplete.</p>

      <p>Wildfires, flood, severe windstorms and heatwaves are just a few of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù emergencies that have become more frequent in the European Union. While we‚Äôre used to preparing for major disasters - earthquakes, cyclones - it‚Äôs time to start thinking about how good maps can save lives and help us navigate better these increasingly common events.</p>

      <p>With a view to preparedness and disaster reduction, we‚Äôll take a look at features worth mapping in OpenStreetMap -- parking lots, vacant businesses, gas stations, ad hoc "cooling centers" -- that you might otherwise overlook and give a short overview of tools like Mapillary and StreetComplete.</p>

      <p>The Contributor Experience team is a new open source community-led project dedicated to developing best practices for onboarding and supporting contributors to open source projects. Initially created as part of a grant directed at four Python projects (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and pandas), our team's goal is to connect with other communities to discuss how to provide a space to reflect, engage, and offer advancements in the work of effective transfer of knowledge, contributor hospitality techniques, project leadership, and communication infrastructure.</p>

      <p>In this presentation, we will discuss our work so far, including ideas on how to foster diverse and inclusive volunteer communities, how to engage with maintainers and project leadership to enact major policy changes, and how to build communities and projects for sustainability, including leadership succession planning.</p>

      a general-purpose operating system based on binary packages that aims to be
      practical and clean, while addressing various shortcomings of an average Linux
      distro. One of the things making it unique is that it's a non-GNU distribution,
      utilizing a combination of userland utilities originating from FreeBSD, the
      LLVM/Clang toolchain and musl libc, besides other things. On top of that, it
      is not based on any existing distribution and comes with its own packaging infrastructure
      and various custom software that was needed to fill in the gaps. It's also highly
      portable, already supporting x86_64, POWER, AArch64 and RISC-V, with more possibly
      coming. In the presentation I will cover the progress made in the last year,

    description: |-
      <p>The distribution follows a rolling release model and by default uses the GNOME desktop with Wayland. The custom package building infrastructure was created after having learned from the shortcomings of equivalent systems in other distros, aiming to be flexible and fast, while emphasizing correctness and allowing for fully sandboxed, unprivileged builds. The result is binary packages/repositories for apk-tools, which Chimera uses as a frontend package manager. The build tooling can also bring the system up from source using a foreign musl-based distribution as a base, making it easily bootstrappable. The resulting repositories utilize LLVM's ThinLTO for nearly all packages, and special emphasis is also placed on security hardening (including CFI and others). Service management is based on the Dinit suite with a custom set of core services and is fully supervising, dependency-based and aims to provide practical parity with systemd, while remaining lean and grokkable (and most importantly, portable). A major aspect of the project is to also improve software portability across the stack, improving the state of matters for both Linux and the BSDs. We also aim to contribute code improvements back to FreeBSD.</p>

      <p>Most importantly, this is not any kind of dogmatic, niche effort. It's a system that tries to be pragmatic, providing a complete package that is polished and has well-defined defaults, while establishing its own identity and not being like something else. We also want to establish a community that is open and welcoming, without pointless elitism, and most importantly have fun doing all of this.</p>

      <p>This is a follow-up presentation to last year's FOSDEM, but I will try my best to make it standalone and as easy to understand as possible for the general audience. Some basic Linux administration knowledge may be necessary for some of the information.</p>

      <p>Termie introduces a new concept in terminal automation: an additional layer of interactivity on top of another interactive terminal session.  Modern debuggers and interfaces can overwhelm console users and clutter the screen with stack traces, excessive debugging information, database query details, and more.  Docker containers can also remove precious command line histories, which makes the console experience more tedious.  Termie allows for persistent histories across sessions, and adds a mechanism for clutter-free interaction.  It also provides some of the functionality of the venerable "expect", to further improve automation of interactive consoles.</p>

      <p>This talk will be about using termie, and about some aspects of its implementation in the Raku programming language.</p>

      <p>Veraison is an OSS project that aims at sensibly reducing the complexity associated with the verification of attestation evidence.</p>

      <p>Remote attestation is the means by which a computational workload can provide trust metrics about itself as well as the processing environment on which it executes.</p>

      <p>Evidence produced by an "attester" is typically used by a relying party to ascertain its security posture, and therefore as a building block to establish trust between the parties involved in distributed computations -- especially those that require a high level of security and privacy, such as in Confidential Computing.</p>

      <p>However, an attestation is pointless if its trustworthiness can't be verified.</p>

      <p>Verification is, in fact, the central function the entire remote attestation architecture relies upon.</p>

      <p>An attestation verifier sits amid a complex network of trust relationships and processes -- including device manufacturing, software life-cycle, and product certification -- and has to make sense of a vast and messy amount of information in order to give the relying party the simple answer it needs to instruct its authorisation policy.</p>

      <p>It provides pre-canned software packages addressing different attestation technologies that can be composed into a verification service.</p>

      <p>To reduce complexity and fragmentation, Veraison embraces standard interfaces as much as possible while at the same time providing enough flexibility to adapt to technology- and deployment-specific needs.</p>

      <p>Veraison has been adopted by the Confidential Computing Consortium in the Linux Foundation.</p>

      <p>"Task scheduling" essentially means asynchronous execution of callbacks, functions. Some kind of a "scheduler" is omnipresent in most services - an event loop; a thread-pool for blocking requests; a coroutine engine - you name it. Scheduler is an important basis on top of which the service‚Äôs logic can be built.</p>

      <p>Gamedev is no exception. I work at Ubisoft - we have miles of code used in thousands of servers, mostly C++. There is a vast deal of task types to execute: download a save, send a chat message, join a clan, etc. Often they compose one multi-step task: (1) take a profile lock, (2) download a save, (3) free the lock, (4) respond to the player. Between each step there is a waiting time until the operation is done.</p>

      <p>One of the game engines‚Äô backend code had a simple scheduler generic enough to be used for every async job in all servers. It juggled tasks across several internal worker threads. But it had the following typical issues:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>Unfairness. Tasks were distributed to worker threads in a round-robin. If tasks differ in duration, some threads can appear choking while others are idle.</p></li>
      <li><p>Polling. In a naive scheduler multi-step task execution works via periodic wakeup of the task. When awake, the task checks if the current step is done and if it can go to the next one. With many thousands of tasks this polling eats notably more CPU than the actual workload.</p></li>
      </ul>


      <p>The talk presents a new highly efficient general purpose threaded task scheduler algorithm, which solves these problems and achieves even more:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Complete fairness - even CPU usage across worker threads and no task pinning;</li>
      <li>Coroutine-like - API to wake a task up on a deadline and for immediate wakeup;</li>
      <li>No contention - operation is mostly built on lock-free algorithms;</li>
      <li>Formal correctness - the scheduler is formally verified in TLA+;</li>
      </ul>


      <p>After the scheduler was implemented in C++ and embedded into several highly loaded servers, it gave N-fold improvement of both RPS and latency (more than x10 speed up for one server).</p>

      <p>At the same time the talk is not C++-specific. It is rather a presentation of several algorithms combined in the scheduler. They can be implemented in many languages: at least C, C++, Rust, Java, C#. Only need support of atomics and threads.</p>

      to build an high-quality MPI evaluation system, higlighting differences between
      API support among multiple implementations, demonstrating the potential of PCVS
      to assess API/ABI support across different implementations. Initially designed
      for validation processing, PCVS is versatile and can handle a wide range of
      use cases, from single test directory to large cluster-wide application stack.

      a simple and intuitive YAML syntax, PCVS allows for flexible and efficient scheduling
      of tests based on massively parallel resources. Our retargeting model allows
      for the remapping of benchmark workflows, commonly associated with compilation
      and execution phases, across multiple environments. This approach has been used
      to build an high-quality MPI evaluation system, higlighting differences between
      API support among multiple implementations, demonstrating the potential of PCVS
      to assess API/ABI support across different implementations. Initially designed
      for validation processing, PCVS is versatile and can handle a wide range of
      use cases, from single test directory to large cluster-wide application stack.
      It should be viewed not as a test framework but as a coordinator between existing
      test bases and supercomputers.</p>"

      <p>All operators start small.</p>

      <p>Usually the first metrics that we add, to a new operator, are the basic ones that help us in the development process.
      When adding the first metrics, developers that are not yet experienced with monitoring, might add metrics that would later cause issues.
      Like, metrics names that would need to be changed, metrics code that would complicate the core operator code, etc and the same for Alerts.</p>

      <p>MetalLB is a load-balancer implementation for bare metal Kubernetes clusters, using standard routing protocols, including BGP. In the past year, the native go based BGP implementation has been replaced by an integrated FRRouting instance running in a container.
      In this talk I am going to briefly introduce how MetalLB leverages BGP to implement Kubernetes services, describe the integration mechanism with FRR and how it made the MetalLB evolution faster and easier. I'll finally explain how the MetalLB CI works, and how we leveraged FRR to mimic various network topologies in order to extend number of scenarios we want to cover.</p>

      <p>Current developments in the field of quantum computer science bring a growing threat against the existing cryptographic algorithms used today, for example in secure Voice over IP and instant messaging applications. Although such a quantum computer has not yet been officially announced, some governments recommends protecting data against this type of attack by 2030. The encrypted data shared today could be stored and decrypted soon thanks to this breakthrough innovation.</p>

      <p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched in 2017 an international competition to standardise "post quantum algorithms". Such algorithms are expected to be resilient to an attack made by a generalist post quantum computer. They are meant to replace in the long term the algorithms that are used today in many secure protocols relying on cryptographic key exchange mechanisms.  The Linphone application is most likely the first open source communication software in the world to have implemented the NIST finalist algorithm in the encryption key category, CRYSTALS-Kyber, as of today. One of the key steps: the development of a modified version of the standardized ZRTP encryption protocol.</p>

      <p>A few challenges we have taken:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>Reach the same level of effectiveness even if cryptographic keys are much larger</p></li>
      <li><p>Remain resilient to classic attacks</p></li>
      <li><p>Be interoperable with encryption features offered by previous versions</p></li>
      </ul>


      <p>The different steps that have been carried out:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>Integration of KEM in ZRTP protocol: creation of a modified version of ZRTP that accepts a key exchange algorithm of the type of Key Encapsulation Mechanism</p></li>
      <li><p>Hybridation : conception of an encryption engine combining a classic (EC)DH and a post quantum encryption. Modification of the ZRTP protocol so that it can negotiate two different key exchange algorithms at the same time and securely combine results.</p></li>
      <li><p>Fragmentation: addition of a mechanism to fragment ZRTP packets</p></li>
      <li><p>Integration in Linphone of this new ZRTP library with post quantum capacities and of configuration settings to activate/deactivate the post quantum mode</p></li>

Restaurant owners, bloggers, big box shoppers, diners - we all have important decisions to make and need instant actionable insights. In order to provide these insights to end-users like us, businesses need access to fast, fresh analytics.</p>

      <p>In this session we will learn how to build our own real-time analytics application on top of a streaming data source using Apache Pulsar, Apache Pinot, and Streamlit. Pulsar is a distributed, open source pub-sub messaging and streaming platform for real-time workloads, Pinot is an OLAP database designed for ultra low latency analytics, and Streamlit is a Python based tool that makes it super easy to build data based apps.</p>

      <p>After introducing each of these tools, we‚Äôll stream data into Pulsar using its Python client, ingest that data into a Pinot real-time table, and write some basic queries using Pinot‚Äôs Python SDK. Once we've done that, we‚Äôll bring everything together with an auto refreshing Streamlit dashboard so that we can see changes to the data as they happen. There will be lots of graphs and other visualisations!</p>

    description: |-
      <p>During 2022 we've been on a mission to completely rework the slowest bits of Matrix, aiming that nobody can ever complain about Matrix being sluggish again. In practice this means fundamental changes in:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>how Matrix syncs data - "sliding sync", where servers only sync the bare minimum data to clients required to render the UI, providing instant login and instant sync (MSC3575)</p></li>
      <li><p>how room joins work over federation - "faster joins", where servers only sync the bare minimum data such that clients can start participating in the room as soon as possible  (MSC3902)</p></li>
      <li><p>how auth works - switching Matrix to use OIDC natively for all authentication, registration and account management (MSC3861)</p></li>
      <li><p>how VoIP works - switching Matrix to natively support multiparty decentralised E2EE VoIP as the primary calling mechanism (MSC3401 and MSC3898)</p></li>
      </ul>


      <p>The end result is transformational, and by far the biggest change to Matrix since the project began in 2014. So, we're calling it Matrix 2.0, and this talk will give a guided tour of everything that's changed - and show off the new reference matrix-rust-sdk client SDK, which powers the new flagship mobile Matrix client, codenamed Element X.</p>

      Coreutils are critical components of any Unix. According to its Wikipedia page, the first versions of cp or chown have been released in November 1971.
      Almost all Linux distros are based on the GNU implementation.</p>

      <p>Fast forward today, a community spawned to reimplement the coreutils in Rust. We are able to boot a Debian with it, build Firefox or LLVM, etc.</p>

      <p>This presentation will explain why we are re-implementing the wheel.
      But also how we are doing it, share some of the corner cases we have been facing, why we are (sometime) faster, etc</p>

      <p>We will also quickly mention the usage of Rust in the Linux kernel.
      With these two projects, we think that we will see more and more core piece of the Linux ecosystem in Rust.</p>

      <p>Europe‚Äôs new rulebook to ensure safe, ethical and transparent online spaces, the Digital Services Act (DSA), entered into force on November 16th. In a few months, this regulation will apply to a range of digital services operating in the EU, from intermediary and hosting services to social media platforms and search engines. The DSA will require big changes from the biggest players in social media and search (those with over 45 million ‚Äòactive monthly users‚Äô in the EU); content moderation capacities, data access transparency tools and annual audits will now be mandated and governed. This groundbreaking text is the first of its kind, and has already inspired both legislation and voluntary corporate practices around the world.</p>

      <p>This lighting talk will speed through the major implications of the DSA and the changes big tech is likely to roll out in response.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>On October 27, the Digital Services Act was published in the Official Journal of the EU, culminating years of legislative and advocacy effort. The regulation will impose a sweeping new regime imposing transparency and accountability requirements on digital services operating in the EU. The DSA is asymmetric in structure, with the largest obligations falling to the largest platforms and search engines - those with a systemic role in society.</p>

      <p>What is an IDS and Network Security Monitoring in 2023?
      Monitoring, Detection, challenges and solutions while chasing APTs, CVEs and Ransomware.</p>

      <p>Challenges keep raising the bar for the security monitoring systems to deal with. From limiting visibility resulting to more and wider encryption adoption to log volumes, to sophistication and amplification of malware attacks and threat actors.
      When multiple systems and integrations are involved the defenders are even more overwhelmed with engineering related tasks.</p>

      <p>APTs and malware actors use any means necessary at their disposal. So should the blue teams around the globe.
      The need for more visibility and faster response arises dramatically. Being able to have full network forensic evidence - including protocol, flow file transactions and packet capture to support the IDS generated alerts - is essential for defenders. However the sheer volume and infra needs can be prohibitive for many deployments scenarios as it is not always only related to just cost. If Open Standard is a key element in lowering the cost and complexity of integration, information sharing is a key element in getting fast detection and reaction.</p>

      <p>In this talk we will walk through some of the challenges that Suricata faces and has solved as it keeps evolving. All that while doing an actual hands on review of real life examples of CVEs exploits and APT, Ransomware proliferation.</p>

      <p>Kubernetes is a great solution for hosting highly available endpoint applications, but network functions can still prove challenging. VPN gateways are notably tricky, with overlay and underlay conflicts making their deployment an interesting dance. Performance is also a challenging topic when speaking about scale, most importantly when common optimizations like GSO don't really apply.</p>

      <p>Leveraging the Calico CNI with a VPP dataplane mixed with multus, allowed us exposing multiple k8s managed interfaces to pods, and thus building complex network functions that still benefit from k8s constructs (HA, service discovery, ...). In the end building an highly available Wireguard gateway gets as easy as building any other application. And it can even leverage accelerated interfaces and cryptographic engines, to reach multiple Gbps without hassle.</p>

      <p>Hoping this architecture could benefit Kubernetes at large, we started drafting a KEP, proposing to upstream the concept of multiple isolated networks, and standardizing their interaction with existing k8s resources.</p>

      <p>PIMMI is a Python software that performs visual mining in a corpus of images. Its main objective is to find all copies, total or partial, in large volumes of images and to group them together. Our initial goal is to study the reuse of images on social networks (typically, our first use is the propagation of memes on Twitter). However, we believe that its use can be much wider and that it can be easily adapted for other studies.</p>

      <p>The main features of PIMMI are therefore:
      - ability to process large image corpora, up to several millions files
      - robustness to some modifications of the images (crop, zoom, composition, addition of text, ...)
      - adaptability to different use cases (mainly the nature and volume of the image corpus)</p>

      <p>A study using PIMMI will generally be broken down into several steps:
      1. constitution of a corpus of images (jpg and/or png files) and their metadata
      2. choice of PIMMI parameters according to the criteria of the corpus
      3. indexing the images with PIMMI and obtaining clusters of reused images
      4. exploitation of the clusters by combining them with the descriptive metadata of the images</p>

      <p>The development of this software is still in progress and we warmly welcome beta-testers, feedback, proposals for new features and even pull requests!</p>

      <p>In this presentation, we will explore this seemingly simple aspect of working with PostgreSQL in details. We will talk about why you want to go beyond the averages, and how to group queries together in the meaningful way so you‚Äôre not overwhelmed with amount of details but find the right queries to focus on.</p>

      <p>We will answer the question on when you should focus on tuning specific queries or when it is better to focus on tuning the database (or just getting a bigger box).</p>

      <p>We will also look at other ways to minimize user facing response time, such as parallel queries, asynchronous queries, queueing complex work, as well as often misunderstood response time killers such as overloaded network, stolen CPU, and even limits imposed by this pesky speed of light.</p>

      <p>In this talk, I‚Äôll dive into the details of WAForth, a tiny but complete Forth interpreter and dynamic compiler for and written in WebAssembly. You‚Äôll see some Forth in action, read hand-written WebAssembly code, get introduced to tools used for working with WebAssembly, hear about JIT compilation for WebAssembly, and learn how you can move all this outside the web platform into native code.</p>

      <p>Computational storage devices (or CSDs) are the new emerging technology that allows offloading computation to storage devices. In this technology, computation is pushed to the storage device (close to the data), and only the final result is returned to main system memory. The efficiency and performance gains come from the reduction in data movement over the I/O interconnects, thus relieving pressure on the memory bandwidth in the traditional Von Nuemann architecture where all data is first moved to the main memory before processing. Despite lots of enthusiasm, proposals, and research publications, there are no immediately available open-source ready to use CSDs available. Due to the lack of such prototypes, it is very hard and challenging to explore hardware, physical interfaces, application APIs (block-level, file system, key-value stores) for CSD devices.</p>

      <p>In this talk, I will present OpenCSD, a completely open-source CSD exploration platform designed with QEMU. OpenCSD uses eBPF as the means to offload computation to the CSD, and includes an accompanying file system. FluffleFS, the file system, uses POSIX extended attributes to interact with the CSD device. The full, open-source implementation including a block-device, programming toolchain and a file system interface; allow anyone to explore the paradigm of computational storage.</p>

      <p>Build recorder: a system to capture detailed information</p>

      <p>An issue that is currently plaguing a number of people working in SBOMs is that, given a generated binary artifact of a project, it is not easy (or even possible) to point back to the exact files that were used for creating it.</p>

      <p>In a typical setup, a project has a number of source files written in a programming language and a build process creates a binary executable.  However, in most cases only a subset of the files is being processed (others being test cases, for example), a number of other files are also used (standard header files residing elsewhere in the system), and a number of tools are being invoked (each introducing another dependency).</p>

      <p>In this presentation we will present build_recorder, an innovative command-line tool that allows tracking of complete and detailed information about every single file that somehow affects the build process.  The tool works transparently while the software is being built, without requiring any change to the source code or build system.  For each file used, a number of attributes are being saved, like name, full path, checksum and exact use.  We will be detailing the information kept, the basics of operation, the generated output format, and planned future enhancements.</p>

      <p>This work has been the result of a 2022 Google Summer of Code project for the GFOSS organization.</p>

In release 2022.07, such support has been added, motivated by use on QorIQ platforms.</p>

      <p>NXP QorIQ platforms require a valid configuration programmed into the boot source in order to boot. Although there is a fallback configuration, it does not support traditional firmware loading interfaces such as USB or Ethernet. By using U-Boot semihosted over JTAG with OpenOCD, a recovery image can be loaded which is sufficient to complete device programming. The same binaries can be used to boot from eMMC as well as JTAG, simplifying configuration. Because semihosting is standard across ARM platforms which support JTAG debugging, similar strategies can be reused whenever JTAG is the most convenient communication method.</p>

      <p>Just using OSS, namely kamailio and rtpengine and using a public cloud provider for hosting (it can be anything), we want to share how we have put an oncall live credit card payment system PCI/DSS certified together.
      We will also go through the infrastructure parts and networking requirements that show how we also did this to be stateless as possible and horizontal scalable towards anyone's need.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>This will be a company sponsored talk by people that advocate for OSS technology adoption. On the call center industry it is often needed to process payments while on call with customers, Talkdesk is a cloud native contact center solution provider where customers demand such feature for their daily usage.
      The talk goal is to show how we at Talkdesk have replaced proprietary resources previously in use, just by OSS namely kamailio &amp; rtpengine and how we have architected a new solution for oncall live credit card payments PCI/DSS certified.
      We will go through some of the issues we were having before with a proprietary dependent implementation and on how we replaced it by a totally new solution totally owned by Talkdesk that just replaced the old buggy proprietary based implementation.
      We will also share how we made the implementation secure, stateless, scalable PCI/DSS certified also being cloud native.</p>

    abstract: "<p>In recent years, the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) has emerged
      as an important practice to manage the risks in the software supply chain. To
      achieve this goal, understanding and managing the dependency is an indispensable
      task when applying the SBOM. In SW360 - a software component catalog application,
      we proposed features to manage SBOM in Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX)
      format last year (https://archive.fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/how<em>to</em>manage<em>oss</em>license<em>obligation</em>and<em>sbom</em>using<em>sw360</em>new_features/).
      But because of the limitation of the old features, dependency management is
      still an urgent problem to be solved. The projects registered in SW360 can only
      create their dependency graphs by searching the components registered in SW360
      dynamically. However, to apply SBOM, it's necessary to enable projects to store
      dependency graphs for themselves. Therefore, Adding the dependency management
      function for projects registered in SW360 is important for importing and managing
      SBOM information such as SPDX information in SW360. This function will also
      help in managing vulnerabilities of projects registered in SW360. To achieve
      this goal, TOSHIBA proposed and developed a series of features in SW360 to help
      users in managing the dependencies of their projects more conveniently. With
      these user-friendly features, users could register, view and modify the dependency
      graphs of their projects flexibly. Combined with the existing SBOM management
      function in SW360, the new features will help users to use SBOM in practice
      more easily. These features will also help SW360 to collaborate with other tools
      and explore more possibilities for managing vulnerabilities. In this presentation,
      I will first explain the issues related to dependency management in SW360. Then
      I would like to introduce and demonstrate these new features of SW360 developed
      by TOSHIBA. These features may include some that are still under development.</p>"

      <p>The Creative Freedom Summit hosted by the Fedora Design Team is an annual virtual event to promote Open Source creative tools, features, and benefits of use. The Summit is a free -day event, with our first year kicking off on Tuesday, January 17th and running through Thursday, January 19th, 2023. Each day featured several informational sessions on various tools and topics related to Open Source creative software, as well as a social session to connect with other participants at the event.</p>

      <p>The Creative Freedom Summit is open to anyone interested in learning more about Open Source tools, how and why to use them, as well as to connect with other creatives working in the Open Source ecosystem. As part of the organisational team, the summit‚Äôs accomplishments and shortcomings will be examined in light of the pilot year of the event. We hope that you will join us and hopefully get involved in the planning for the next one! Or perhaps you‚Äôll be motivated to organize your own Open Source Design event.</p>

The Summit is a free -day event, with our first year kicking off on Tuesday, January 17th and running through Thursday, January 19th, 2023. Each day featured several informational sessions on various tools and topics related to Open Source creative software, as well as a social session to connect with other participants at the event.</p>

      <p>The Creative Freedom Summit is open to anyone interested in learning more about Open Source tools, how and why to use them, as well as to connect with other creatives working in the Open Source ecosystem. As part of the organisational team, the summit‚Äôs accomplishments and shortcomings will be examined in light of the pilot year of the event. We hope that you will join us and hopefully get involved in the planning for the next one! Or perhaps you‚Äôll be motivated to organize your own Open Source Design event.</p>

      <p>New technologies such as Kubernetes and methodologies such as microservices are changing how software is developed, delivered, and deployed. Additionally, bringing new products to the hands of users is happening much faster than before, making Continuous Delivery a critical aspect of doing business. The way we do business is evolving at a tremendous pace and keeping up with the technology and tooling can often put strains on companies regardless of size or number of employees. Knowing where to start is one issue but then once you‚Äôve started how do you scale. Do you need more tools, which tools do you need, what resources do you have to help you pick the right path to keep your company running efficiently, how do you train your developers while they continue to do their day jobs? The CD Foundation was formed and incubates projects that address these challenges in an open-source, vendor-neutral manner.</p>

      <p>Using best practices from graduated projects like Jenkins and Tekton as well as incubating projects like CDEvents and Spinnaker, the CD Foundation is working on the CD Reference Architecture to help take the guesswork out of tooling and scaling and creating a blueprint on how to establish, structure or modernise your CI/CD infrastructure. This talk will go over some examples of the CD Reference Architecture and resources available to help make CD accessible for your organisation.</p>

      <p>The level of privacy awareness once reserved for messaging applications is reaching other forms of online collaboration such as office suites. Many companies, including "big tech", claim that their platforms enable users to privately collaborate. However, the definition of what privacy actually means varies widely. While there are no ways to verify claims made about proprietary software, the impact on users is very tangible.</p>

      <p>CryptPad is an end-to-end encrypted open source collaboration suite. It seeks to reconcile collaboration and privacy. Users make changes to documents and these are encrypted by their client (web browser) before being sent to the server for real-time synchronization. In this talk I will detail CryptPad's privacy definition and introduce the assumed threat model of an honest-but-curious server. While users have to trust the server to not actively attack their privacy, they can nevertheless protect themselves against a passively sniffing server. I will show why end-to-end encryption is not enough, but must be combined with open source to achieve reasonable privacy in this model.</p>

      <p>In the world of manufacturing, a bill of materials (BOM) constitutes a quantified list of raw materials and components used to produce, for instance, a given refrigerator. The equivalent in the software world would be a list of all third-party libraries needed to compile, test, and release a software product. There is, however, a significant difference between the BOM for a refrigerator and a software product. Unlike for refrigerators, not all software products' ingredients (i.e., third-party libraries) are actually used!</p>

      <p>In this talk, we will present findings from our recent academic research comparing SBOMs generated from different sources of abstraction (i.e., manifest data and call graph data) to highlight that potential inaccuracy can hamper the actionability of SBOMs. Evaluating the severity of security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries is one such example. Moreover, we will also demonstrate from a recent experiment that available tools generate different SBOMs for the same software product, showcasing that SBOMs are not trivial to standardize. Finally, we will wrap up the talk with a discussion on challenges and opportunities to establish a ground truth for SBOMs.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec/">CrowdSec</a> project aims at providing a crowdsourced approach to common infrastructure defense problems by distributing free &amp; open-source software allowing you to protect yourself and share information about malevolent actors.</p>

      <p>In this Presentation, we will:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Learn about CrowdSec project</li>
      <li>Learn how to install CrowdSec in Kubernetes</li>
      <li>Learn how you can detect and block attacks in your applications deployed in k8s</li>
      </ul>
    description: |-
      <p>CrowdSec could be perceived as a modern form of Fail2ban, though for Cloud and container-based infrastructure as well, and capable of taking way more advanced decisions a lot faster. Mainly, it‚Äôs using a decoupled and distributed approach (detect here, remedy there) and an inference engine that leverages leaky buckets, YAML &amp; Grok patterns to identify aggressive behaviors. It acquires signals from various data sources like files, syslogd, journald, AWS Cloudwatch and Kinesis, Docker logs, and Windows Event Log, normalizes them, enriches them to apply heuristics and triggers a bouncer to deal with the threat if need be. Since it‚Äôs written in Go, it‚Äôs compatible with almost any environment, fast in execution, and resource-conservative.</p>

      <p>The endgame is the Reputation engine, though. If you want to partake in the network to benefit from its findings, CrowdSec captures all aggression signals (timestamp, IP, behavior) and sends them for curation. That way, it establishes a reliable IP blacklist that is constantly redistributed to the network members to achieve a form of Digital Herd Immunity. An IP caught aggressing WordPress sites will quickly be banned by all members using CrowdSec that subscribed to the WordPress defense collection. In that way, we share the IPs that are relevant to your technical context.</p>

      <p>While Crowdsec is in charge of the detection, the reaction is performed by "bouncers" that aim to be deployable at any level of the applicative / infrastructure stack :</p>

      <ul>
      <li>via nftables/iptables/pf based on an IP set</li>
      <li>via Nginx lua plugin</li>
      <li>via Traefik middleware</li>
      <li>on Cloudflare via our bouncer that integrates with Cloudflare API</li>
      <li>Or GCP/AWS/Azure firewall, slack or scripting, notifications, etc.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>.. or in many other ways. Over time the possibilities will increase as the application design basically supports anything.</p>

      <p>This approach, combined with a declarative configuration and a stateless behavior, will make it an ideal candidate to enhance the security of modern stacks (containers, Kubernetes, serverless, and more generally automatically deployed infrastructures).</p>

      <p>Furthermore, we intend to create and share the most accurate database of malevolent actors possible in the form of a real-time IP reputation system accessible through API. Whenever an attack is locally blocked/detected by Crowdsec, the "meta" information of the attack is shared amongst participants (source IP, date, and triggered scenario) for redistribution to network members.</p>

      <p>We are committed to building a strong community with all that it implies :
      * <a href="https://hub.crowdsec.net">a public hub</a> to find, share and amend parsers, scenarios, and blockers
      * permissive open-source license to stay business-friendly
      * and overall a strong commitment to transparency and community-first mentality by tooling and behavior</p>

      <p>The microservice architecture is the most significant security challenge in a Kubernetes cluster. Every application you deploy opens a new potential entry for attackers, increasing the attack surface.
      In this talk, we'll present the Crowdsec project and see how we can protect a Kubernetes cluster using Crowdsec and the power of the Crowd.</p>

Mainly, it‚Äôs using a decoupled and distributed approach (detect here, remedy there) and an inference engine that leverages leaky buckets, YAML &amp; Grok patterns to identify aggressive behaviors. It acquires signals from various data sources like files, syslogd, journald, AWS Cloudwatch and Kinesis, Docker logs, and Windows Event Log, normalizes them, enriches them to apply heuristics and triggers a bouncer to deal with the threat if need be. Since it‚Äôs written in Go, it‚Äôs compatible with almost any environment, fast in execution, and resource-conservative.</p>

      <p>The endgame is the Reputation engine, though. If you want to partake in the network to benefit from its findings, CrowdSec captures all aggression signals (timestamp, IP, behavior) and sends them for curation. That way, it establishes a reliable IP blacklist that is constantly redistributed to the network members to achieve a form of Digital Herd Immunity. An IP caught aggressing WordPress sites will quickly be banned by all members using CrowdSec that subscribed to the WordPress defense collection. In that way, we share the IPs that are relevant to your technical context.</p>

      <p>While Crowdsec is in charge of the detection, the reaction is performed by "bouncers" that aim to be deployable at any level of the applicative / infrastructure stack :</p>

      <ul>
      <li>via nftables/iptables/pf based on an IP set</li>
      <li>via Nginx lua plugin</li>
      <li>via Traefik middleware</li>
      <li>on Cloudflare via our bouncer that integrates with Cloudflare API</li>
      <li>Or GCP/AWS/Azure firewall, slack or scripting, notifications, etc.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>.. or in many other ways. Over time the possibilities will increase as the application design basically supports anything.</p>

      <p>This approach, combined with a declarative configuration and a stateless behavior, will make it an ideal candidate to enhance the security of modern stacks (containers, Kubernetes, serverless, and more generally automatically deployed infrastructures).</p>

      <p>Furthermore, we intend to create and share the most accurate database of malevolent actors possible in the form of a real-time IP reputation system accessible through API. Whenever an attack is locally blocked/detected by Crowdsec, the "meta" information of the attack is shared amongst participants (source IP, date, and triggered scenario) for redistribution to network members.</p>

      <p>We are committed to building a strong community with all that it implies :
      * <a href="https://hub.crowdsec.net">a public hub</a> to find, share and amend parsers, scenarios, and blockers
      * permissive open-source license to stay business-friendly
      * and overall a strong commitment to transparency and community-first mentality by tooling and behavior</p>

      <p>The microservice architecture is the most significant security challenge in a Kubernetes cluster. Every application you deploy opens a new potential entry for attackers, increasing the attack surface.
      In this talk, we'll present the Crowdsec project and see how we can protect a Kubernetes cluster using Crowdsec and the power of the Crowd.</p>

      <p>The twitter-explorer is an open-source research tool that allows users without programming skills to collect, transform and visualize Twitter data through the paradigm of networks. It represents different types of platform-specific interaction patterns (retweet, mention, quote, reply) as interactively explorable networks, 2D-spatialized through a force-directed layout algorithm. The tool, and more specifically its interactive aspect, which allows users to read tweets of users from within the network visualization, was built out of a necessity to go back to the actual data in order to understand why certain nodes find themselves in the position they are in. We call this process "guided close-reading": the structural overview given by the spatialized network allows the social scientist to find, sort and then analyze relevant content through traditional methods from discourse analysis in order to generate hypotheses about the underlying debate on Twitter.</p>

      <p>In this presentation, I would mainly like to discuss the intricacies of tool-building for the social sciences, more specifically the use and interpretability of force-directed layout algorithms, as well as get feedback on the architecture of the tool itself, which is written in Python and JavaScript.</p>

      <p>Increasingly, industry is using Linux on embedded systems to take advantage of its flexibility and existing (open source) functionality. This allows them to connect Cyber-Physical Systems, which have stringent safety requirements, to the Internet so that they can do remote management and monitoring. However, the flip side of the flexibility coin is decreased availability. Not only can a lot more go wrong in such a complex operating system, if an attacker would be able to get root access on such systems, all bets are off.</p>

      <p>Our research project makes use of hardware Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), now readily available on even low-end commodity devices, to provide a secure and always available execution context for safety-critical programs. By integrating a real-time scheduler inside of OP-TEE OS running in an Arm TrustZone TEE, it is possible to safeguard the real-time execution requirements of these programs, even under the influence of Linux kernel panics and remote attackers with root privileges. This presentation will explain the system architecture that resulted from our research, its implementation on a common Arm processor and a quick demo showcasing the core functionality.</p>

      <p>Authentication among distributed workloads is a critical yet complex task. PKI-based authentication relies heavily on software to anchor the trustworthiness of workloads, therefore failing to reliably convey the security state of the workload in the face of impersonation and persistent attackers. This is most apparent in cases where the underlying platform is particularly exposed and out of the control of the owner, such as in cloud computing and IoT. Hardware features have thus been introduced to enable remotely verifiable ‚Äútrust metrics‚Äù using attestation. Such hardware-backed features provide a cryptographic proof of the software stack, and strong guarantees that the cryptographic keys used by the workload are properly protected from exfiltration. However, remote attestation comes with its own need to share and verify metadata, which must be engineered into existing software. While the protocol used to exchange this metadata is largely irrelevant to the actual attestation procedure, its positioning in the networking stack can enable specific use-cases and enhance the performance of the entire system. An appealing approach is to allow the creation of secure channels (such as TLS connections) using attestation metadata as the authentication mechanism. Current designs either rely on running an attestation protocol on top of an existing secure channel, or modify the semantics of certificates to convey attestation information when establishing the secure channel.</p>

      <p>Our work focuses on standardising attestation metadata as first-class credentials in TLS. This new approach allows native, opaque metadata to be conveyed for authentication during the TLS handshake instead of (or together with) x509 certificates. Supporting flexibility in deployments without compromising on security has been a prime goal. Thus, we aim to cater to interaction models in which either the client, the server, or both can attest themselves, leveraging any hardware backend, and using different verification topologies. To showcase the standardisation effort, we are also developing an open-source, end-to-end proof-of-concept implementation of one of the interaction models supported. The PoC builds on top of two Linux Foundation projects ‚Äì Parsec to abstract the root of trust attestation primitives, and Veraison to consume and verify the new evidence formats ‚Äì and modifies mbedTLS to support a subset of the newly defined TLS extensions. As a hardware root of trust, the proof of concept is currently using a TPM2.0, with support for others being considered.</p>

      <p>Like many programming communities, the Java community lacks a simple open-source profiling UI. In the quest to build such a UI, I found the Firefox Profiler to be the closest to an adaptable polyglot profiling UI.
      This talk gives an overview of how to adapt and integrate the Firefox Profiler to use it to view profiling data from different sources, like JDK Flight Recordings.</p>

      <p>Reflection is a very powerful JVM feature that allows to create implementations of interfaces on the go, as well as exploring the type hierarchy, methods and properties of a given class.
      These capabilities do not exist in Kotlin/Multiplatform, so we will explore an alternative method to runtime reflection: a compile-time symbol processor to create compile time mirrors.
      Using Mocking as an excuse (as mocking typically needs reflection), we will explore how we can use KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processor) to circumvent the absence of reflection and generate efficient test mocks at compile time. We will also see the limitations that multiplatform brings to both the KSP generator and its associated runtime, and we will explain the tradeoff that needs to be made when using KSP, and why they are needed.</p>

      <p>Formal verification is the act of proving the correctness of software using mathematics. That means proving that your code is free of bugs and/or follows its specifications. SPARK is both a language (subset of Ada) and a set of tools that bring automatic formal verification in the hands of any developer.</p>

      <p>This technology is getting more interest from the industry (e.g. NVIDIA recently) for its extremely powerful properties in terms of safety and security. However, it is not widely known that SPARK is both open source and very easy to start using.</p>

      <p>In this talk I will provide quick and easy instructions to start your first formally verified library in SPARK. Using only free and open-source tools and resources (compiler, package manager, IDE, verification tools).</p>

      <p>In this talk we discuss the implementation of file system and networking in Enclave OS for the AWS Nitro platform in detail.</p>

      <p>An AWS Nitro enclave represents a separate VM with it's own processor cores, memory and a running OS kernel. External networking and storage are not available by default inside an enclave. The only way an enclave can communicate with the outside world is through a vsock connection to the parent VM. Enclave OS provides network access to the applications inside an enclave by proxying network packages over this vsock connection. Offering secure persistent storage to nitro enclaves is more challenging. Enclave OS saves the state of the application in a network block device. Data is transferred into the device via the vsock network channel that connects the enclave and parent in a nitro instance. It is secured by utilizing the Linux kernel's Device Mapper features like dm-verity and dm-crypt.</p>

      <p>Free and Open Source Software has successfully democratized access to code and technology. FOSS has become  the common, universal base for software development. However, despite ‚Äúwinning‚Äù the industry, FOSS largely stops with 'software at rest' (the runtimes, toolchains, and code components used when running your environment and building your applications). Upstream projects can take these software components and run them, but putting them into production at scale is mostly protected as proprietary knowledge by the companies offering cloud services on top of FOSS.</p>

      <p> FOSS enabled the evolution of computing through cloud and microservices, as well as the increasing ubiquity of software control in the physical world. With this widespread adoption the challenges to FOSS have changed: the software industry has remade development into the aggregation of black-box services running on infrastructure controlled by a third party. It has, in essence, re-created the problem of the mainframe. To survive, FOSS must evolve through open sourcing operations. Operate First is one way to do that.</p>

      <p>For most people, an emulator is a way of running old software (usually games) on new hardware. But using an emulator to step through the original ROM code of an old computer can provide insights on how the machine worked, teaching us tricks that were usually the preserve of hardware hackers.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we cover seven different machines (including perennial home computers like the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64, along with the Dragon 32, and consoles like the Gameboy) to deep dive on a single element of their implementation. We explain how data can be transfered without a data bus, why it's quicker to check for multiple results instead of one, or what is the legally optimal series of bytes for copy protection.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Beginning with a brief overview of the era in question, 1980-1985, we begin by looking at each of the 7 machines, showing an open source emulator, and how it works in a normal scenario. We then highlight a portion of the code to examine, and break down the reasons for it being written in the way it was. For each machine, we focus on the way the code makes the machine work showing a practical use to emulators that is often overlooked.</p>

      <p>We end with a number of "honorary mentions" of ROM code that exists for non-essential purposes, such as Easter eggs.</p>

      set is called safety case. This safety case is nothing else than an (S-)BOM
      of the safety release. This talk will demonstrate how SPDX relationships can
      be used to generate this "Safety SBOM" as evidence for a complete safety case.</p>

      <p>In 2017 I spoke at FOSDEM and told everyone about how Containerised App technologies like AppImage, Snap, and Flatpak were all terrible and posed the question "What could go wrong?" if we introduced them.
      Now, in 2022, I am building a Desktop Linux distribution that <em>only</em> uses Flatpaks for it's Apps, so obviously, something went horrifically wrong, but not with Flatpaks.</p>

      <p>This talk will revisit some of my arguments from 2017, and discuss how the Flatpak team in particular embraced and addressed those concerns. It will also revisit the arguments advocating for traditional packaging and how they increasingly fall down when compared to the Flatpak way of doing things. That said, this session will try to present a balanced argument, and highlight the risks and responsibilities this approach requires and how some of the containerised app technologies still fail to meet those challenges.</p>

      <p>As a conclusion, this session will present a vision for more distribution and packaging projects to follow, possibly narrowing the scope of their efforts to better collaborate and embrace the potential on this new way of getting FOSS software in the hands of users.</p>

      <p>An important sign of intelligence is the capacity to apply a body of declarative knowledge to a particular situation in order to, e.g., derive new knowledge, to determine relevant questions or to provide explanations.

      <p>FO(.) (aka FO-dot) is the Knowledge Representation language used by the IDP-Z3 reasoning engine.</p>

      <p>FO(.) was introduced by Prof. Denecker (KU Leuven).
      It is based on  first-order logic (FOL) for its constructs (i.e., logic connectives and quantification).
      FO(.) extends FOL with a few language constructs to express complex information such as non-inductive, inductive and recursive definitions, and  aggregates.</p>

      <p>An FO(.) Knowledge Base consists of a vocabulary and a "theory".
      The vocabulary describes the domain-specific symbols that are used in the theory.
      A theory is a collection of assertions about possible state of affairs.
      There are three classes of assertions: constraints, definitions and enumerations.
      States of affairs are represented by structures, that contains the values of the symbols of the vocabulary.
      A structure that is possible according to the theory is called a model.</p>

      <p>A Knowledge Base (KB) written in FO(.) cannot be run: it is just a "bag of information" formally describing models in a problem domain.
      This is a consequence of the FO(.) design goal to be task-agnostic.
      A corollary is that such a KB does not distinguish inputs from outputs, and allows reasoning in any direction.</p>

      <p>A key advantage of the model-theoretic semantics is that it allows reasoning with incomplete knowledge of the state of affairs.
      This knowledge is encoded in a partial structure.
      When not much is known, many states of affairs are possible, and the theory has many models representing them.
      As more information is obtained, the set of models is reduced.
      This reduced set of models can be used to perform various forms of reasoning, e.g., to derive the consequences of what is known, or to find the model that maximizes a utility function.</p>

      <p>As a very simple example, consider the voting law that states: "You have to vote in an election if you are at least 18 years old at election time (otherwise you can not)".
      The formula in FO(.) is:</p>

      <pre><code>vote() &lt;=&gt; 18 =&lt; age().
      </code></pre>

      <p>If the age is known, the obligation to vote can be inferred;
      if the obligation to vote is known to be true instead, the age is known to be 18 or more, in any model.
      Furthermore, one can also find a lower bound of the age of a person, as soon as their obligation to vote is known.</p>

      <p>IDP-Z3 is a reasoning engine that can perform a variety of reasoning tasks on knowledge bases in the FO(.) language.
      The following generic computations are supported by IDP-Z3:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Model checking: Verifies that a theory is satisfiable given a structure, i.e., that it has at least one model.</li>
      <li>Model expansion: Takes a theory T and a partial structure S, and computes a model of T that expands S, if one exists.</li>
      <li>Propagation: Takes a theory T and a partial structure S, and computes all their logical consequences, i.e., all the ground literals that are true in every model expansion of T and S.</li>
      <li>Explanation: Takes a theory T, a partial structure S and a literal L obtained by propagation, and computes an explanation for L in the form of a minimal set of axioms in $T \cup S \cup {\lnot L}$ that is inconsistent.</li>
      <li>Optimisation: Takes a theory T, a partial structure S and a term, and computes the minimal value of the term in the set of all model expansions of T and S.</li>
      <li>Relevance: Takes a theory T and a partial structure S, and determines the atoms that are irrelevant (or ``do-not-care'') in the sense that, if one of their value were changed in any model M of T expanding S, the resulting M' structure would still be a model of T.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>IDP-Z3 can be run at the command line, or integrated in a Python application as a Python package downloadable from pypi (https://pypi.org/project/idp-engine/).
      Computations can also be run online via a webIDE (https://interactive-consultant.idp-z3.be/IDE).
      It is open source (https://gitlab.com/krr/IDP-Z3) under the LGPL 3 license.</p>

      <p>IDP-Z3 comes with a demo web application, called the Interactive Consultant, that helps users make decision in accordance with an FO(.) knowledge base, using the reasoning abilities of IDP-Z3.</p>

      <p>It is generic in the sense that it can be reconfigured by simply changing the FO(.) knowledge base.
      The user interface is automatically generated based on the vocabulary of the knowledge base: this helps reduce the cost of developing applications significantly.
      It is available online (https://interactive-consultant.idp-z3.be/).</p>

      <p>The Interactive Consultant (IC) allows the user to enter data in any order.<br/>
      The IC enables a safe exploration of the decision search space, without the possibility of making decisions leading to dead ends.
      This is achieved by continuously computing the consequences of the data theory, using propagation.
      If the user is unsure why the IC propagated a specific choice, they can ask for an explanation.
      Additionally, while the user fills in what they know, the interface determines which parameters remain relevant, avoiding unnecessary work for the user.
      After having input all values that they deem necessary, the user can ask the IC to show the optimal decision according to what is known, using optimization.</p>

      <p>The aim of this session is to discuss about Container Storage Interface (CSI), its specification and
      details on additional advanced operations provided by CSI-Addons.
      CSI specification defines an interface along with the minimum operational and packaging recommendations for a storage provider (SP) to implement a CSI compatible plugin. The interface declares the APIs that a plugin MUST expose: this is the primary focus of the CSI specification.
      The CSI-Addons project hosts extensions to the CSI specification to provide advanced storage operations. By adding new procedures to the CSI-Addons Specification, additional operations for storage systems can be provided. The reference implementation is done on Kubernetes, and maintained in the Kubernetes CSI-Addons repository. Some of the advanced storage operations that are currently supported are reclaim space, network fence, volume replication and encryption key rotation.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The presentation will cover the following outline:
      1. Introduction to Container Storage Interface  (CSI)
         - The Container Storage Interface (CSI) aims to enable Storage Providers to write one CSI compliant Plugin that ‚Äújust works‚Äù across all Container Orchestrators (CO) that implement CSI.
      2. Architecture &amp; Terminologies
        - The primary focus of CSI specification is on the protocol between a CO and a Plugin. It SHOULD be possible to ship cross-CO compatible Plugins for a variety of deployment architectures. In this section, we will be discussing in-depth, the architecture of CSI-Specification and related terminologies.
      3. All about CSI-Addons
        - The CSI-Addons project hosts extensions to the CSI specification that provide advanced storage operations. We will be discussing various aspects of the CSI-addons project further in our talk.
      4. Working and Demonstration of Advanced storage operations provided by CSI-Addons:
         i. Reclaim Space: The Reclaim Space specification defines an extension to the CSI Specification that will enable Storage Providers (SP) to develop controllers/plugins that can free unused storage allocations from existing volumes.
         ii. Network Fence: The Network Fencing specification provides a mechanism that Storage Providers can implement to network-fence any client using corresponding CIDR (Classes Inter-Domain Routing) blocks.
         iii. Volume Replication: The Volume Replication specification provides a mechanism that Storage Providers can implement to support async-replication which can be used for disaster recovery operations.
         iv. Encryption key rotation: The Encryption Key Rotation specification provides a mechanism that Storage Providers can implement to rotate keys for encrypted volumes.</p>

      PKINIT, and security considerations for implementers and deployers.
      I will present and demonstrate a recently discovered PKINIT security
      flaw in some older (but still supported) versions of FreeIPA.</p>

      <p>Linux container escapes continue to affect Kubernetes and derived
      products. User namespaces are one technology that can mitigate the
      risk. In this presentation I will explain the past, present and
      future of user namespace support in Kubernetes, and discuss how to
      run systemd-based containers in user namespaces. And why you would
      even want to try. There will be demos!  Attendees will learn about
      what containers are, the technologies that underpin Linux
      containers, and how Kubernetes actually runs containers.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>"systemd in a container? What! Why!?" We had our Reasons, and I'll
      even explain them.  But more interesting than the "why" is the
      "how", and that's what this talk is about.  Come and learn about the
      upcoming and in-development Kernel and Kubernetes security features
      that will enable better container isolation and secure deployment of
      systemd-based workloads.</p>

      <p>This is a talk about what happened when a handful of complete
      container newbies tried to port their massive, complex, legacy
      application to Kubernetes.  As a monolithic container.  Based on
      systemd.</p>

      <p>The runtime shunned our container and refused to execute it.  Cloud
      engineers recoiled in horror at our architecture.  With astounding
      hubris we ignored their admonitions and doubled down.  If the
      container runtime won't run our application, well, we'll just modify
      the container runtime!</p>

      <p>And so we did.  Our journey took us into the darkest corners of
      container runtimes, Kubernetes and systemd.  And we have emerged to
      tell you the tale.  There will be demos.</p>

      <p>Attendees will learn about the security technologies that underpin
      Linux containers, including namespaces and cgroups, as well as the
      behaviour of systemd in containers.  I will also discuss the recent
      and planned changes in Kubernetes to provide official support for

      <p>So much of our knowledge is recorded as textual data. The knowledge is there, but extracting insights out of it is a challenge. Imagine the time you spend trying to get to that one piece of information that you know is buried somewhere in your piles of documents. In this presentation, we will approach this problem by building our own semantic search application in Python, using Haystack.
      Haystack is an open source NLP framework and its key building blocks support a variety of semantic search pipelines. In this presentation, we will walk through one particular application of semantic search: question answering. We will also have a look at:</p>

      <p>Existing audio/video conferencing solutions of type ‚ÄúMultipoint control unit‚Äù or ‚ÄúMediamixing mixer‚Äù, have proved to be costly in terms of resources in the case of video processing, due to the algorithm complexity of video codecs. This constraint leaded to the emergence of new solutions transmitting a useful subset of the streams received from all the participants, to each participant. For example: only the video of the actively talking participant is dispatched to each participants, together with some very low resolution video streams of the other participants.
      This technology is referred to as ‚ÄúSelective Forwarding Unit‚Äù (SFU) or ‚ÄúSelective Forwarding Middlebox‚Äù (SFM). These solutions open the path to conference sessions managed by a server that does not decode the media content.
      The main benefit of a Selective Forwarding Unit is that it is capable of receiving multiple media streams and then decide which of these media streams should be sent to which participant. That way it is technically possible to enhance the number of participants to a group call.</p>

      <p>Linphone is likely to be the first open source SIP-based conferencing solution powered by a modern SFU server. As the server solution already used for Instant Messaging features was already compatible with open standards for the function of managing group chatrooms and their participants., the idea was to enhance this component with media capabilities. Therefore the Linphone team developed a SFU algorithm on top of mediastreamer2 and ortp (Linphone‚Äôs media processing libraries), inside of a new software component called ‚ÄúMS-SFU‚Äù.</p>

      <p>This talk will focus on the following topics:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>compatibility of the conference establishment mechanism with SIP and the RFC 4579 (SIP Call Control - Conferencing for User Agents)</p></li>
      <li><p>stream selection performed by the SFU based on the current audio level of participants</p></li>
      <li><p>implemented standards to allow the communication between the Linphone's library and the Flexisip conference server in SFU mode</p></li>
      <li><p>how this technology paves the way for a future major innovation: end-to-end encryption for real-time audio and video conferences</p></li>

      <p>Our talk will present two sister projects, Next Generation Internet (NGI) Search and OpenWebSearch.
      The objective of the former is to support innovative projects to develop trustworthy solutions towards the development of new ways of searching data by addressing the challenges of power cognitive search, natural language processing, and social computing amongst other cutting-edge fields through five Open Calls. The projects will be compliant with open, collaborative and unbiased values.
      On the other hand, NGI OpenWebSearch has its origins in concerns over the imbalance of the search engine market, that are dominated and limited by a few gatekeepers.  Thus, information as public good, with free, unbiased, and transparent access is not under public control anymore. Over the next three years the researchers will develop the core of a European Open Web Index (OWI) as a basis for a new Internet Search in Europe.</p>

      <p>Both projects will lead to more transparency and choice with a focus on privacy and trust, contributing to the overall vision of a more human-centric Internet.</p>

      We will then show how security keys can be used as an alternative to more traditional hardware security solutions like smartcards.

      We will explain how attestation works and how you can prove that a signature was made using a security key, and how to reliably determine the type of security key used.
      We will show what FIDO extensions can be used, for instance to store small data files such as certificates on a security key, or to derive symmetric keys that can be used to encrypt data.</p>

      <p>TEDective is a free software (open-source) solution that makes European public procurement data explorable for non-experts. Let‚Äôs say you are a curious citizen who wants to find out how much taxpayer money your municipality spends each year on unfree software. To date, there is no free software-backed, community-developed application out there that helps you answer this question.</p>

      <p>TEDective changes that by bringing light into the public procurement data published by the EU‚Äôs Tenders European Daily (TED) project. It transforms the XML files provided by TED into the interoperable Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) and then visualizes the data as a graph of relationships between companies and the public bodies they supply. Currently, neo4j is used to store the TEDective graph. Finally, the data will be enriched by other complementary data sources such as OpenCorporates and OpenSanctions.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Every year, public institutions in the EU spend more than ‚Ç¨2 trillion on various goods and services. While the EU publishes a lot of data about public procurement in the form of TED (https://ted.europa.eu), somebody interested in European public procurement still faces a lot of difficulties: TED data is overly complex, doesn‚Äôt follow the international and interoperable Open Contracting Data Standard and is hard to explore as the UI provided by TED is limited to basic filtering and search.</p>

      <p>This situation was the starting point for TEDective ‚Äì an initiative by the Free Software Foundation Europe to make European public procurement data both accessible and explorable - for everybody. We believe that the transparency needed by such a solution to function in the interest of its users can only be provided by a community-led free software project. TEDective is such a project. The project already won the first prize at this year‚Äôs EU Datathon. With this initial funding, we are now keen to spread the word and build a community of data science, procurement and usability experts who can help us in our quest to open up and democratise European public procurement data.</p>

      <p>In the talk, we will show you what we have done so far and how you can help us make TEDective more useful every day.</p>

      <p>TEDective is a free software (open-source) solution that makes European public procurement data explorable for non-experts. Let‚Äôs say you are a curious citizen who wants to find out how much taxpayer money your municipality spends each year on unfree software. To date, there is no free software-backed, community-developed application out there that helps you answer this question.</p>

      <p>TEDective changes that by bringing light into the public procurement data published by the EU‚Äôs Tenders European Daily (TED) project. It transforms the XML files provided by TED into the interoperable Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) and then visualizes the data as a graph of relationships between companies and the public bodies they supply. Currently, neo4j is used to store the TEDective graph. Finally, the data will be enriched by other complementary data sources such as OpenCorporates and OpenSanctions.</p>
    raw_description: |-
      <p>Every year, public institutions in the EU spend more than ‚Ç¨2 trillion on various goods and services. While the EU publishes a lot of data about public procurement in the form of TED (https://ted.europa.eu), somebody interested in European public procurement still faces a lot of difficulties: TED data is overly complex, doesn‚Äôt follow the international and interoperable Open Contracting Data Standard and is hard to explore as the UI provided by TED is limited to basic filtering and search.</p>

      <p>This situation was the starting point for TEDective ‚Äì an initiative by the Free Software Foundation Europe to make European public procurement data both accessible and explorable - for everybody. We believe that the transparency needed by such a solution to function in the interest of its users can only be provided by a community-led free software project. TEDective is such a project. The project already won the first prize at this year‚Äôs EU Datathon. With this initial funding, we are now keen to spread the word and build a community of data science, procurement and usability experts who can help us in our quest to open up and democratise European public procurement data.</p>

      <p>In the talk, we will show you what we have done so far and how you can help us make TEDective more useful every day.</p>

      <p>Centralized proprietary collaboration software has recently faced a grown scepticism. In November 2022, the French Government officially asked schools to not use Google's and Microsoft's collaboration services. Luckily there are open source alternatives that can be self-hosted to give individuals and institutions more contol over their data. While users thus do no more need to rely on big companies, they still need to trust the system administrators hosting the software to respect the user's privacy.</p>

      <p>CryptPad is an end-to-end encrypted open source collaboration suite. It seeks to reconcile collaboration and privacy. Users make changes to documents and these are encrypted by their client (web browser) before being sent to the server for real-time synchronization. CryptPad hides the technicalities of encryption from its users and provides a clean and intuitive interface to ease fast adaption.
      In this talk I will present how CryptPad keeps the user's data private and protects them against a passively sniffing server. I will show why we combine end-to-end encryption with open source and will talk about the ecosystem around CryptPad.</p>

      <p>The idea of the microkernel OS architecture is more that 50 years old and the term itself is just a few years younger. Over the years, it has been implemented in countless variants and modifications, it has served as a basis for intriguing OS experiments, it has gained strong position in the mission-critical and safety-critical areas and while it is still not the dominant architecture in the general-purpose desktop OS domain, it has had major influence on the "mainstream" operating systems as well.</p>

      <p>This talk, however, is not about the history. Instead, we describe where are the microkernel-based operating systems today, who works on them and why, who uses them in production and why, where they aim for the future. The purpose of this talk is also to present the basic practical experiences with the existing microkernel-based operating systems ‚Äî not to compare them, but to provide the potential users and contributors with an initial sorted list of operating systems they should look into in more detail depending on their needs.</p>

      Topics for the talk are:
      - Why we had a closed source solution in the first place
      - Problems caused by RFC non-compliance, specifically related to wildcard handling
      - Missing features in the selected OSS solution (PowerDNS) and how we fixed them
      - How we tested and rolled out the final solution
      - Scaling issues we ran into once it was deployed and how we solved them</p>

      <p>As an embedded software engineer, I'm used to be at the border between software and hardware.
      However, for many years I delegated everything more complex than finding a GPIO number
      to a dedicated hardware team.</p>

      <p>Now working as a freelance engineer, I've decided to get over the barrier, to be more independent.
      In this talk, I'll share my journey to the hardware world, from simple hardware designing
      and routing using free software to more complex design review.</p>

      <p>As a big difference between hardware and software is the required equipment, I will
      also go through the equipment I had to buy and how I use it.</p>

      <p>I hope to convey the message that while hardware is a vast world, it is a real
      advantage for the software engineer to get familiar with a few basic tools of
      our hardware colleagues.</p>

      for example the speed or temperature of a compenent. For this kind of data traditionally
      there was no standardized semantic and no standardized way how it is represented

      <p>Java is now more than 25 years old and throughout the Age of Java there has been many tools for shrinking, optimizing and obfuscating Java bytecode. This was and is especially important for mobile devices, which have certain resource constraints, from the early J2ME devices to today's Android devices.</p>

      <p>Today, in the Age of Kotlin, shrinking is more relevant than ever and not just for mobile applications. As well as mobile Android applications, desktop &amp; server applications are also ever growing in size; for example Compose for Desktop typically generates large application packages. JetBrains has recently integrated ProGuard into the Compose for Desktop Gradle plugin to tackle this issue.</p>

      <p>But what has changed and how does Kotlin affect shrinkers like ProGuard (which is 20 years old and originally created to process Java compiler produced bytecode)? How does ProGuard shrink classes produced by the Kotlin compiler? The Kotlin compiler just produces Java bytecode anyway, so nothing changes?</p>

      <p>The talk will take a look at ProGuard under the hood and what's required to process Kotlin apps &amp; libraries. In particular, there will be a deep dive into Kotlin metadata and how ProGuard (via the ProGuardCORE library) makes use of JetBrains' kotlinx.metadata library to read &amp; write the metadata.</p>

      <p>Isn‚Äôt it a cool idea to understand societies of interstellar civilization? While this may look like a fictional scenario, I believe academically serious studies can be done through simulations. Because special relativity plays a role in this scenario, it is not a strict forward task to implement interstellar social model using existing social simulation framework. As a result, I have created an open source simulation framework, Relativitization, to ease the model development.</p>

      <p>In this presentation, I will introduce the architecture of the framework and how the framework can be used. Besides that, I will introduce a complex social model, a.k.a., a turn-based strategy game, developed based on the framework. I believe the game is useful for educating relativistic physics to the public. As a Ph.D. student in social science with a background in physics, developing an open source software is a challenging process. I will also share my experience in overcoming the challenges.</p>

      <p>Desktop and server software at the present moment in time is very rarely developed with its energy consumption as a major consideration.

      <p>The Green Metrics Tool is an open source framework that allows for measuring, comparing and optimizing the energy consumption of arbitrary software. The goal is to empower both software engineers and users to make educated decisions about libraries, code-snippets and software in order to save energy and thus carbon emissions.</p>

      <p>Any application will be containerized and then analyzed by its logical parts. The open source tool measures classical performance metrics as well as energy related metrics like wattage, temperature and cooling efficiency to understand what part of the software is responsible for which part of the energy consumption.</p>

      <p>Through the concept of usage scenarios we create an interface for developers to test/develop against. In the end this makes complex software products comparable to each other and thus enables developers to select libraries based on their functionality-energy-profile (for instance messages per Watt or similar).</p>

      <p>We present the roadmap for this tool over the next year, which will result in a public and open database of energy information for arbitrary hardware setups, code blocks and libraries and a green standard library / green code completion.</p>

      of a mapping-interface [1] to explore one of the fined grained statistical dataset
      on the french population (number of inhabitants / km¬≤,  the average income per
      consumption unit, the percentage of low-income households, ...). These data
      were derived from localized tax revenues of households and were available in
      a very fine way i.e on pixels of only 200m x 200m, they were delivered at this
      time by the French National Institute of Statstics (INSEE) throught a massive
      spatial data file, which limited their use to a very limited number of people
      able to handle it. The proposed interface changed this and allowed almost any-body
      to visualize easily these data in their browser. In this presentation we will
      mainly discuss how to make such massive spatial data easily accessible to the
      public. The proposed solution is based on multi-scale aggregation: at high scales,
      the data are aggregated and at fine scales the final resolution of 200m by 200m
      is recovered. This interface, which heavily rely on zoom in/zoom out interactions
      allows users to deal and play with one of the well known problem in geography
      and spatial statistics namely the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem [2] (ie. Data
      tabulated for different spatial scale levels or according to different zonal
      systems for the same region will not provide consistent analysis results). This
      tool has leads to several interactions with new users (journalist, researchers,
      simple citizen,...) that seem to demonstrate its interest. Since this first
      project, several other massive datasets (one concerning an updated of the same
      data-set and one concerning a dataset on all french building) were made available
      with almost the same system [3,4]. From a technical perspective, this talk will
      covers the different evolution and open-sources projects that has made this
      project possible (d3 / postgres / postgis / mapLibre,Leaflet, ...), discussing
      vector tiles formats, map viewer evolution and a little bit of spatial databases

      wrong with fbdev? How do I even allocate buffers? Why won't Wayland give me
      1000fps on glxgears? If GPUs are so very fast, why does everyone tell me I can't
      use them because they're slow? And what do these window system people even do
      all day, anyway? The talk is aimed at anyone who wishes they understood the
      complexity of modern display pipelines, plans for future development, and how
      to develop applications &amp; products that use the full capability of modern
      hardware at maximum effectiveness.</p>"

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>Fuzion is a new functional and object-oriented language that aims at unifying
      different concepts to reduce the complexity of the language and tools processing
      code written in Fuzion.  The biggest difference between functional and
      object-oriented languages is the handling of side-effects: In an ideal
      functional world, all functions are pure, i.e., free from side-effects, while in
      object-oriented languages like Java it is common to make frequent use of side
      effects, e.g. a Java method to read data would usually be a function <em>read()</em>
      that would return the read data and have the side-effect of advancing the
      current position in the input to the next element.</p>

      <h2>Side Effects</h2>

      <p>Side-effects may come in very different forms: I/O operations that interact with
      the outside world are just one example, other side effects are access or
      modification of global state, program termination or early abortion of some
      operation (e.g., via throwing an exception), logging, thread interactions,
      yielding data to a co-routines, etc.</p>

      <h2>Algebraic Effects</h2>

      <p>An algebraic effect is a set of operations that provide a certain functionality
      that may include side-effects.  The idea is that any function that requires such
      an operations must do this explicitly, static that it depends on the
      corresponding effect.  Any caller of a function that requires a certain
      algebraic effect either itself requires that same effect, or it must provide a
      handler that implements that effect.</p>

      <p>As an example, say a function <em>f</em> performs some logging operation, so it
      requires a <em>logger</em> effect that has an operation <em>log</em> that adds one line of
      logging data.  Any caller <em>g</em> of <em>f</em> therefore also depends on the <em>logger</em>
      effect, unless <em>g</em> itself would provide an implementation of the <em>logger</em> effect
      to be used by <em>f</em>.  If <em>g</em>, e.g., provides a no-op <em>logger</em> implementation that
      does nothing in its <em>log</em> operation, then <em>g</em> could be pure and not depend on an
      effect, all the logging information created by <em>f</em> would be ignored.  If,
      however, <em>g</em> would provide a logger that writes the log messages to a file, then
      <em>g</em> would no longer require the <em>logger</em> effect, but instead require some file-I/O
      related effect.</p>

      <p>Operations of an algebraic effect usually return a result, but they may also
      abort the current calculation and directly return the the place the effect was
      installed.  This makes effects somewhat similar to exception handling in some
      languages. But effects are more general, an operation of an effect may resume
      (return) an arbitrary number of times.</p>

      <h2>Type Parameters</h2>

      <p>Type parameters or generic types are common in many languages.  Usually, type
      parameters are treated completely separately from normal 'value' parameters.  In
      Fuzion, this distinction has been removed, type parameters are treated like
      value arguments only that the their actual value is a type.  This permits adding
      functionality to types and performing operations on types such as creating an
      value of a given type.</p>

      <h1>Fuzion Language Overview</h1>

      <p>Fuzion is a modern general purpose programming language that unifies concepts
      found in structured, functional and object-oriented programming languages into
      the concept of a Fuzion feature.  It combines a powerful syntax and safety
      features based on the design-by-contract principle with a simple intermediate
      representation that enables powerful optimizing compilers and static analysis
      tools to verify correctness aspects.</p>

      <p>Fuzion was influenced by many other languages including Java, Python, Eiffel,
      Rust, Go, Lua, Kotlin, C#, F#, Nim, Julia, Clojure, C/C++, and many more.  The
      goal of Fuzion is to define a language that has the expressive power present in
      these languages and allow high-performance implementations and powerful analysis
      tools.  Furthermore, Fuzion addresses requirements for safety-critical
      applications by adding support for contracts that enable formal specification and
      enable detailed control over run-time checks.</p>

      <p>Many current programming languages are getting more and more overloaded with new
      concepts and syntax to solve particular development or performance issues.
      Languages like Java/C# provide classes, interfaces, methods, packages, anonymous
      inner classes, local variables, fields, closures, etc.  And these languages are
      currently further extended by the introductions of records/structs, value types,
      etc.  The possibility of nesting these different concepts results in
      complexity for the developer and the tools (compilers, VMs) that process and
      execute the code.</p>

      <p>For example, the possibility to access a local variable as part of the closure
      of a lambda expression may result in the compiler allocating heap space to hold
      the contents of that local variable.  Hence, the developer has lost control over
      the allocation decisions made by the compiler.</p>

      <p>In Fuzion, the concepts of classes, interfaces, methods, packages, fields and
      local variables are unified in the concept of a Fuzion feature. The decision
      where to allocate the memory associated with a feature (on the heap, the stack
      or in a register) is left to the compiler just as well as the decision if
      dynamic type information is needed.  The developer is left with the single
      concept of a feature, the language implementation takes care of all the rest.</p>

      <h1>Side-effects and Security</h1>

      <p>Unexpected side-effects in library calls are the cause of a number of recent
      security vulnerabilities such as log4shell.  The talk will give some examples.</p>

      <h1>Algebraic Effects in Fuzion</h1>

      <p>In Fuzion, algebraic effects are features that inherit from a standard library
      feature <em>effect</em>.  Algebraic effects are identified by their type, so different
      heirs of <em>effect</em> create different operations.  So the declaration of an effect
      <em>my</em>effect<em> that provides an operation </em>my<em>operation</em> is a feature declaration
      of <em>my</em>effect<em> inheriting form </em>effect<em> and declaring an inner feature
      </em>my<em>operation</em>.</p>

      <p>Since the caller of a feature has to provide an implementation of an effect, it
      is said that an effect has to be present in the environment of a given call. The
      syntax to access an operation <em>my</em>operation<em> of an effect of type </em>my<em>effect</em>
      uses the keyword <em>env</em> as follows: <em>my</em>effect.env.<em>my</em>operation<em>, meaning that
      we take the implementation of </em>my<em>effect</em> from the current environment and then
      perform <em>my</em>operation_ on it.</p>

      <h2>Algebraic Effect Examples</h2>

      <p>The talk will interactively show how effects can be declared, used and
      installed.</p>

      <h1>Type Parameters in Fuzion</h1>

      <p>The talk will present the syntax of type parameters and the declaration of
      operations associated with types.  This enables a functional counterpart static
      methods in languages like Java without adding global state.</p>

      <p>It will be shown how this can be used to implement an abstract equality
      operation that permits the definition of different implementations for different
      types along an inheritance hierarchy.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion and Next Steps</h1>

      <p>The addition of effects and type parameters were important steps to make the
      language more powerful while staying true to the spirit of Fuzion which is to
      simplify and unify aspects as much as possible.</p>

      <p>A small team of developers is now working on the Fuzion implementation with a
      focus on the standard library, performance and interfaces with other languages.</p>

      <p>Main points that are missing right now are</p>

      <ul>
      <li>a powerful standard library</li>
      <li>additional library modules for all sorts of application needs</li>

      <p>Integration testing of GNOME, a desktop environment built from more than 200 separate components, is tricky. Since 2010 folk have been working towards better testing, and one outcome is the testing-only VM image "GNOME OS", built from the latest "main" and "master" branches of GNOME.</p>

      <p>Now we're trialling OpenQA to automatically detect regressions in GNOME OS as soon as they happen. In this talk, I'll speak a bit about how we got here, where we're going and some tips for getting started with your own OpenQA testing.</p>

      <p>This talk will cover all the new features and changes in Delve since the last in-person FOSDEM and then go right into a deep-dive into how Delve enables extremely low-overhead tracing of Go programs using eBPF.
      Attendees will learn not only how to use this new feature of Delve, but also how they can leverage eBPF in their own Go programs. I will start by introducing this new feature, showcasing how it can be used, and
      then I will take the audience into an in-depth look at how it is implemented under the hood. The talk will feature a code walkthrough and detailed explanation of the technical details that went into making this
      feature a reality. I will also talk in depth about the libraries and approaches used to enable Go programs to leverage eBPF, which will empower attendees to implement such a feature in their own applications as
      well.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>This talk is accessible to any level of Go programmer, from novice to advanced. Novice users will get a lot of benefit from learning how to use the tracing feature in Delve to track down problems in their code,
      while intermediate to advanced users will get a lot of information from the technical deep dive and will also walk away with the knowledge of how to integrate eBPF programs into their own codebases. The information

      <p>Software compartmentalization decomposes applications into lesser-privileged
      components that only have access to what they need to do their job. Properly
      applied, compartmentalization can limit the impact of many memory safety issues
      by containing corruption within the vulnerable component. Use-cases are
      plentiful: library sandboxing, protection of SSL keys, sandboxing of
      network-facing code, and more.</p>

      <p>In the last decade we have seen the appearance of many new mechanisms that
      enable compartmentalization at a relatively low performance cost (Intel PKU,
      the upcoming Intel PKS, CHERI hardware capabilities, vmfunc). This generated a
      lot of research with a strong focus on compartmentalizing existing software, at
      a fine grain (isolating libraries or components), and as automatically as
      possible.  The promises are great: the compartmentalization of legacy software,
      with a low engineering effort, and at a low performance cost.</p>

      <p>Alas, in this process, the interfaces between compartments are often neglected:
      they are hard to reason about and difficult to secure automatically, and
      compartmentalizing at finer and finer-grain exacerbates the issue. This is a
      major problem, as weak interfaces enable for many attacks well-known in the
      confidential computing world.</p>

      <p>In this talk I will present the result of a study on the impact of neglecting
      compartment interfaces. I will define and classify compartment interface
      vulnerabilities, and present a fuzzer specialized to catch them. Having applied
      it to 25 popular applications and 36 possible compartment APIs, revealing 629
      interface vulnerabilities, I will present insights into what makes interfaces
      vulnerable, and how to make them more resilient when compartmentalizing.</p>

      <p>This talk goes over the upcoming VA-API virtio video decoder backend currently in the works for the CrosVM hypervisor. It explains how the flexibility of Virtio technology can be paired with a very established API in order to produce a robust solution in video decoding virtualization, effectively blending the worlds of stateful and stateless interfaces. It details how the community at large stands to benefit from it and how it both validates and helps propel the development of the work-in-progress virtio video protocol itself.</p>

      <p>The talk will also cover the latest developments in the work in progress VirtIO Video protocol and delve in the architecture of cros-codecs, which is a project that aims to offer video decoding capabilities to the Rust ecosystem as a whole.</p>

      <p>The operating systems in use today and their interfaces and abstractions were designed decades ago and have predominately remained stagnant. In contrast, the evolution of computer hardware has seen significant changes over the decades. The last decade's research has shown that the abstractions and interfaces conceived decades ago have become a bottleneck, so the interplay of OS and applications needs to be revised.</p>

      <p>But exploring new interfaces and abstractions in an OS is a daunting and often intimidating endeavor. One often has to dig into hundreds of thousands of lines of existing OS code or write an OS entirely from scratch for hardware that is either sparsely documented at best or, too often, not at all.</p>

      <p>The major challenge in developing a research OS is that a vast number of drivers need to be implemented to get the system running. And this effort comes with little or no scientific output at all. This is where Genode can rescue the day with its strictly component-based architecture. It provides the flexibility and extensibility needed to accelerate OS research while also providing the drivers required to get the system running.</p>

      <p>This talk will show how Genode can lift the burden of creating new research operating systems. Using our research operating system as an example, we will show how easy it is to explore various OS interfaces and abstractions and how to automate experiments using Genode's scenarios. Furthermore, we will highlight the challenges we faced using Genode on multicore servers and outline what extensions to the framework we needed to implement.</p>

      <h3>Exposure Notification</h3>

      <p>The goal of Exposure Notification was to use mobile phones to detect potential exposure to Covid 19 carriers, and to then communicate this information to the appropriate people in a suitably privacy-respecting way.</p>

      <p>Different countries chose different methods for achieving this, but within Europe the Google/Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) protocol become one of the most widely used approaches. The protocol satisfied two important requirements: interoperability and privacy. The first comes from its deployment to all up-to-date Google and Apple devices everywhere in the world, offering truly global interoperability. The second from the careful and thoughtful design of the protocol itself.</p>

      <p>In this talk I will chart my experiences developing my own open source implementation of the GAEN protocol for use with Germany's exposure notification infrastructure. This eventually turned into the open source libcontrac library, and the Sailfish OS Contrac App, with equivalent functionality to that of the German Covid Warn App developed by SAP. Contrac gained quite widespread use within the Sailfish community.</p>

      <h3>Working with Other Organisations</h3>

      <p>Google and Apple released a specifications for the protocol very early on, and using this it was possible to release a cross-platform open-source library implementation of the protocol even before the official version rolled out to Android and iOS phones. However, this only tackled half of the problem, since the infrastructure for communication with health authorities was developed separately and independently by each country that used it, and this wouldn't be deployed until later.</p>

      <p>I will therefore also talk about SAP's Covid Warn App backend implementation. SAP put great effort into developing this using an open source model. On the one hand their approach was very successful and achieved its purported goals, in that it made it possible to develop a fully-independent, fully open-source, fully-functional re-implementation of the Covid Warn App for use on Linux-based mobile phones. On the other hand, my personal experience of working with the project left something to be desired. In this talk I will therefore also explore some of the traps that organisations fall into when managing large, government-level, open source projects, and in particular in relation to how they interact with small independent contributors.</p>

      <p>Strings can seem like one of the most innocuous data structures in Go. Yet, they still play a significant role in most ubiquitous types of programs, such as text processors, in-memory key-value stores, DNS resolvers, or codecs. Their burden on the performance of such programs becomes especially pronounced in distributed systems and cloud-native environments, where the number of strings within an instance of the software can reach an order of millions or more. This gives rise to performance issues and bottlenecks, especially with regard to memory consumption.</p>

      <p>To provide answers to these problems, the talk will discuss several string-optimization techniques. To be more accessible for both beginner and intermediate levels, the talk will first state the problem and briefly introduce strings as a data structure, and will explain how strings look internally in Go. The core of the presentation will be dedicated to discussing operations with strings and how these can be optimized based on various techniques, such as string interning and string concatenation. The author will also share his experience and practical examples of open-source programs, where these techniques are being applied.</p>

      <p>Strings can seem like one of the most innocuous data structures in Go. Yet, they still play a significant role in most ubiquitous types of programs, such as text processors, in-memory key-value stores, DNS resolvers, or codecs. Their burden on the performance of such programs becomes especially pronounced in distributed systems and cloud-native environments, where the number of strings within an instance of the software can reach an order of millions or more. This gives rise to performance issues and bottlenecks, especially with regard to memory consumption.</p>

      <p>To provide answers to these problems, the talk will discuss several string-optimization techniques. To be more accessible for both beginner and intermediate levels, the talk will first state the problem and briefly introduce strings as a data structure, and will explain how strings look internally in Go. The core of the presentation will be dedicated to discussing operations with strings and how these can be optimized based on various techniques, such as string interning and string concatenation. The author will also share his experience and practical examples of open-source programs, where these techniques are being applied.</p>

      <p>Free-libre open design hardware grows out of free software. Hardware has greater capital costs than software and is much more expensive to deploy. Medical hardware is more expensive still. Nonetheless, the COVID-19 global pandemic showed that the fragility of our global supply chains kill people. Open source medical hardware is a potential solution to this predictable catastrophe. In coming decades, we hope it will be as common as free software is now.</p>

      <p>The PolyVent ventilator was started to address a predicted shortfall in human mechanical invasive and non-invasive ventilators in 2020. This never came to pass in the West, for medical reasons, but it was not a panic‚Äîit was a reasonable surmise based on limited data at the time. Over 100 teams tried to create open source ventilators; PolyVent is one of the few still active and fully open.</p>

      <p>The PolyVent is completely open and very modular to allow for educational tinkering and graduate-level research. It runs fully open software called VentOS which can drive any electromechanical ventilator based on an extensible hardware driver model. It uses a ‚Äúsuper loop‚Äù Arduino framework deployed with PlatformIO.</p>

      <p>Combined with other modules, such as the VentMon monitor which provides a clinical display in a public data lake and the GPAD (General Purpose Alarm Device), it is an educational platform that has been piloted at one University. Although not for clinical use, we hope for-profit firms will create clinical ventilators based on this design. We understand how to assist such firms in obtaining regulatory approval.</p>

      <p>Confidential compute is a powerful new paradigm. However yet it is not easy to use and many developers are hampered from enclaiving their applications. We have developed and open-sourced THE BASE, a set of 18 containerized applications by default leveraging Intel SGX technology. THE BASE covers popular open source applications, such as mariadb, mongodb, redis or runtime environments like python, java, go, rust, ruby. With THE BASE project we aim to help developers to enclave their workload without investing to much time. THE BASE is docker, docker swarm and kubernetes compatible, and requires no change to devops or code.</p>

      <p>In this talk I'll present the project and give some live demos.</p>

      <p>Digital technology is a major contributor to environmental harm, whether it is the 'tsunami' of e-waste filling landfills or the CO2 emissions on a par with with aviation industry.</p>

      <p>Oft overlooked is that software plays a crucial role. For instance, software bloat means less powerful hardware may stop working and end up as toxic waste in landfills, while new devices are manufactured unnecessarily -- the production of which often costs more energy than the usage over their operating life. Moreover, software bloat also entails that the software will have higher energy demands and pump more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere -- in order to achieve the same result. Digital sustainability is, in many ways, a question of software.</p>

      <p>The Blue Angel ecolabel, the official environmental label of the German government, began certifying software in 2020. In the award criteria, sustainability is closely linked with transparency and user autonomy. This connection has been one of the motivations behind the KDE Eco initiative since its beginning in 2021. In this talk I will present the environmental harm driven by software, with a focus on energy consumption. I will link the values of Free and Open Source software to sustainable software design. Finally, I will provide an overview of the work of the KDE Eco project and the new sustainability goals of KDE.</p>

      <p>"Go Even Further Without Wires" is the thrilling part 3 of the "Go Wireless Saga".</p>

      <p>In "Go Without Wires", we wrote TinyGo code that runs directly on Bluetooth devices.</p>

      <p>In "Go Further Without Wires", we used TinyGo to connect to WiFi networks, and consequently to the Internet itself.</p>

      <p>Now, we will extend our reach further out into the real world, with TinyGo programs that can connect to Wide Local Networks (WAN) using the long distance radio protocol LoRA/LoRAWAN.</p>

      <p>This talk will include several live demonstrations, including a flying object.</p>

      <p>Managed Kubernetes offerings deliver a great set of features [autoscaling, loadbalancing, introspection, backups, automatic updates]. Applying the Confidential Computing concept to entire Kubernetes clusters ensures always-encrypted data and eliminates the service provider's access but also contradicts the managed approach. Fully isolated and self-managed clusters provide maximum control and privacy but do not offer smart features out of the box. This results in a tradeoff between ease of use and security. We present a Kubernetes-native approach, allowing a cluster to manage itself while offering many features known from fully managed alternatives.</p>

      <p>The solution comes in the form of open-source microservices that provide secure and autonomous joining of new nodes, autoscaling, failsafe node OS updates, and even Kubernetes upgrades.</p>

      <p>The talk covers microservice design patterns that give control back to the Kubernetes administrator.</p>

      <p>Additionally, we explain how remote attestation can help our system to verify each software component of a Kubernetes node during the bootstrapping process, adding that extra level of security to an autonomous architecture.</p>

      <p>Finally, we explain how you can securely automate the Kubernetes node lifecycle: How nodes can prove their integrity and can join Kubernetes clusters autonomously without relying on a trusted third party to mediate the process.</p>

      <p>Energy transition is a major challenge that no one can tackle alone. Collaboration across national boundaries and sectors and within civil society is necessary and open data and open-source software are promising tools to identify costs and opportunities and accelerate the uptake of net‚Äëzero technologies, especially in developing countries where resources are often scarce. However, except for few notable institutions, in-house software and data dominate industry and policy decision making in energy matter.
      Many large entities have been historically reluctant to use open-source software and open data, for concerns including data quality, technical support on open tools, lack of features, or reliability of results.  Nevertheless, the open community has been developing several tools for various energy applications, which can meet many needs by utilities, policy makers and industry. However, despite the open-source alternative, often closed software is still the standard approach.
      The presentation will describe the status of open data and open-source tools adoption in the energy sector will be discussed, including a proposal on how to fill the missing steps using community of communities: open-source communities shall help each other towards practical adoption. Focus will be given on the comparison of features provided by selected in-house models and the open-source counterpart, including the examples by PyPSA and PyPSA meets Earth initiatives that actively promote open data and open-source tools for global energy planning. The initiatives have demonstrated that fully open energy modelling, from the data till the solver, is already possible at Continental scale with reasonable accuracy, even in areas where data access is generally more difficult, such as at African level. In conclusion, the major lessons learnt from open energy modelling initiatives will be drawn, highlighting synergies among open-source communities to foster adoption.</p>

      importance of encrypting data in use (the core idea behind Confidential Computing).
      Confidential Computing is evolving rapidly and is starting to gain adoption
      by CSPs, but user adoption is still slow. But what if encrypting data in use
      became the default way to deploy applications, both in the Cloud and even on
      premises? In this session, we‚Äôll discuss what are the main roadblocks towards

    description: |-
      <p>There are three states in which data can be protected: at rest, in transit, and in use. Encrypting data at rest (e.g. files, objects, storage) and in transit (e.g. TLS, HTTPS) have become a common practice, while encrypting data in use (the core idea behind Confidential Computing) is still an emerging concern.</p>

      <p>But while a common practice today, encrypting data in transit only gained wide adoption with the Let‚Äôs Encrypt movement, which was fundamental in changing the general mindset from ‚Äúencryption is only important for e-commerce and banking applications‚Äù to ‚Äúlet‚Äôs encrypt everything by default, no matter what‚Äôs the application‚Äù. Confidential Computing is just starting to emerge, and most use cases are restricted to sectors like healthcare and banking, which require greater assurances that their sensitive code and data are protected.</p>

      <p>We will look back at the Let's Encrypt project, which started 10 years, to understand why this movement was so successful and how we can replicate this success for encrypting data in use. Our hope is to make encrypting data in use the default way for deploying applications, which will fundamentally change the security approach that exists today.</p>

      <p>Sailfish OS is an embedded Linux distribution developed by Jolla that‚Äôs designed to run primarily on phone and tablet hardware. The Sailfish community has a proud hardware adaptation track record, having ported Sailfish OS to devices as wide ranging as watches, feature phones, smartphones, tablets and PC hardware. Despite the breadth of successful ports, the process of adapting Linux to a new phone platform can be daunting for new porters. On the other hand, the Sony Open Devices Program makes the process of opening up a selection of Sony‚Äôs Xperia mobile phones for use by porters as easy as possible.</p>

      <p>In this presentation I‚Äôll look at the process of porting Sailfish OS to Sony Open Device Program devices, see how the Open Devices Program helps in practice, and also look at some of the tools, documentation and infrastructure made available by Jolla to help with this process.</p>

      <p>I‚Äôll talk about my own journey as a porter, how I came to start porting and the work I‚Äôm doing now porting Sailfish OS to different Sony Xperia devices. I‚Äôll also talk about how Sailfish porters are able to work with the Sony Open Devices Program for mutual benefit, pushing changes upstream that then flow back down to make porting Sailfish OS or other Linux variants to other Xperia phones in the Open Devices Program more streamlined and reliable.</p>

      <p>I will aim to provide enough technical detail so that developers who haven‚Äôt yet tried porting can go away and get started, but will also aim to include material that is of general interest to more casual mobile phone and Linux users.</p>

      <p>The Linux Kernel Functional Testing (LKFT) project is aiming at improving the
      quality of the Linux kernel by performing functional testing on Arm hardware.</p>

      <p>LKFT has built over 1 millions kernel per years other the last two years and
      ran 140 millions tests on both emulation (qemu) and hardware devices.</p>

      <p>In this talk I will present the current architecture that is able to build and

      <p>The Whippet garbage collector provides an abstract interface that user programs (like Guile) can use to allocate memory, and also provides a number of collectors that implement that API.  One of them is the BDW-GC collector: this will be the first step in Guile's switch to Whippet, to change to use the Whippet API but keep the same GC implementation.  Compile-time flags choose the collector implementation, and in the next step, Guile will switch over to Whippet's main collector, an Immix-derived mark-region collector.  This collector has a few modes, including a heap-conservative mode that mimics BDW-GC, as well as a stack-conservative mode that allows evacuation and compaction of objects that aren't referenced by conservative roots.</p>

      <p>The talk will include a quick overview of Immix-style collectors, for context.</p>

      <p>Whippet scales: it has been carefully designed to avoid contention during allocation, and avoid locking except during collection.  Collection is optionally parallel and optionally generational.  We'll examine the performance and practical impacts of these choices, in synthetic test harnesses and in real Guile programs.</p>

      <p>Whippet is designed to be included into a user's C source code, as it needs compile-time configuration.  The talk will show examples of the size of the collector and its memory efficiency when compared to BDW-GC and to a semispace collector.</p>

    description: |-
      <p>From a software developer's point of view the German calibration law is not so much about measuring energy correctly or invoicing the correct prices, but a first step towards a more modern zero trust architecture for the e-mobility charging infrastructure. This security update is sorely needed, as todays architecture is full of well-known, yet unaddressed bugs and design flaws mainly caused by the very the bad communication of people in distributed systems and across gated communities.</p>

      <p>Besides solving technical goals, the German Eichrecht also tries to make sure, that the security gurantees also reach the end users and give them all required tools, data and information to verify the correctness of their charging sessions. Therefore for us Open Source is not only a non-functional, nice-to-have marketing feature off the calibration law or just more cost effective way of shared software development, but a fundamental (functional) requirement. Unfortunately the applicability of the calibration law for those end users is still very low. With the upcoming version 2.x of our Chary Transparency Software we not only introduce multi-language support to support the adoption of the German Eichrecht all over Europe, but also present new services like a real public key infrastructure for energy meter public keys and incremental charge transparency records for a "Real-Time Eichrecht".</p>

      <p>PostgreSQL has supported national language support (NLS) (that is, message translations) with Gettext for over twenty years.  This has been a valuable feature, but naturally not without challenges.</p>

      <p>I have been involved in this effort as a toolsmith, organizer, and translator.</p>

      <p>We have had interesting challenges making Gettext work reliably in a client/server system and to make it cooperate with the other internationalization facilities in the system.  We also had to write a lot of our own tooling to manage the translation work, merges with the code, and so on.  We also have translations of the documentation, which use separate workflows.  PostgreSQL is a relatively small community and the software is mostly not facing end users, so the possibilities for recruiting translators and other volunteers for this are limited.</p>

      <p>In this presentation, I want to give an account of the work we have done in the PostgreSQL project to make translation and internationalization in general an integral part of the project and start a conversation with other practitioners about best practices and the future of the tooling.</p>

      <p>OTA updates should happen frequently and install quickly even with growing OS and application sizes at limited data throughput and limited on-target storage.
      Untrusted cloud storage or communication channels also increase the need for encryption.</p>

      <p>This talk will give an overview of how the RAUC update framework had to overcome some limitations of the early design to address these challenges without
      compromising its original goals.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>In 2015, the RAUC update framework was started as an Open Source project to end the era of home-grown shell-script Embedded Linux and IoT system update 'solutions'.
      More than seven years later, RAUC has been used in many diverse projects, of which Valve's Steam Deck is probably the most widely known.</p>

      <p>The focus of this talk will be the introduction of the 'verity' update bundle format in RAUC that has not only improved the verification process but has also allowed extending RAUC by built-in HTTP(S) network streaming support, adaptive delta-like updates, and full bundle encryption.</p>

      <p>Driven by the frequent demand to allow decoupling more frequent app or container updates from full A/B OS updates, the talk will give an outlook on recent developments about reconciling this with RAUC's principles.</p>

      <p>Deploying to "the cloud" is incredibly convenient, but that convenience normally comes at a cost.

      This prevents several highly-regulated sectors, such as medical or financial, from directly deploying to "the cloud" as opposed to building their own infrastructure.
      Solutions to this problem exist, but most require a custom and <em>correct</em> implementation tied to a particular hardware vendor and SDK.

      <p>Package managers are essential tools in any Linux system, designed to install, upgrade, remove, and manage software. For several years, Fedora had YUM, which became DNF eleven years ago. Now, DNF5 will replace DNF and be the new Fedora standard.
      In this talk, we will give an introduction to DNF5. We aim to address our new design principles and how our choices fix some of DNF's design flaws. We will present a live demo of the new product to showcase some features of DNF5 and make comparisons with DNF. Lastly, we will cover our plan to improve communication, inclusion, and openness with the open-source community.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>It is public knowledge that the DNF codebase became cluttered and, at times, substandard, cutting off a large slice of the open-source community from participating in the development process and decision-making process. Likewise, historical design decisions held DNF back from evolving into a modern and sustainable package manager.
      We want to answer how certain design issues were addressed, and why the structure of DNF5 impacts environments such as the desktop, containers, and CI.
      Moreover, we will go over the user experience of our command-line interface in the live demonstration, with some examples of common use cases and a speed comparison of processing commands between DNF and DNF5.
      Lastly, we will discuss how DNF5 enables us to work closer with the community. A thoroughly documented codebase, transparent upstream issue tracking, and open feature planning and delivery are all requirements that we intend to fulfill.
      Our target audience is people with some degree of expertise in package management or who are proficient using DNF.</p>

      <p>This presentation illustrates how the Guix project provides software deployment for reproducible research.  GNU Guix takes care about the computational environment from the package management to producing container (Docker, Singularity) and also being an alternative for virtual environment.</p>

      <p>Open science means transparent and collective; transparent because a scientific result needs to be scrutinized and studied bug-to-bug, and collective because an independent observer must observe the same result‚Äìat least when speaking about computational processing‚Äìand this observation needs to be sustainable.  Guix is an attempt to implement, for the computational environment, these two items.</p>

      <p>By applying functional programming concepts to package management, pioneered by Nix, Guix is deeply transparent by design.  The whole computational environment is captured and its inspection, from source code to binary, becomes tractable.  As a nice consequence, this computational environment is reproducible from one machine to another.  What about missing source code?  Guix is able to transparently fallback to the Software Heritage archive.  The reproduction of this computational environment becomes sustainable‚Äìto some extent.</p>

      <p>In short, this presentation try to convince how Guix and 3 command lines can helps open science.</p>

      <p>This talk will present how support for an advanced camera use case was integrated
      into the mainline Linux kernel, using the Media and V4L2 APIs. It involves
      supporting a sensor using the raw Bayer RGB format, transmission over the
      MIPI CSI-2 bus as well as support for the Image Signal Processor (ISP) found on
      Allwinner platforms. A specific focus will be set on this ISP, with details
      about the features it implements as well as the internal and userspace APIs
      that are used to support it.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Capturing pixels with a camera involves a number of steps, from the ADC reading
      the photosites in the image sensor to the final pixel values that are ready for
      encode/display, with various processing and transmission taking place along
      the way.</p>

      <p>While simple cases put most of the heavy lifting on the image sensor's side
      (through its embedded processor) and use a simple parallel bus for transmission,
      advanced cases require more work to be done outside of the sensor. In addition,
      modern high-speed transmission buses also bring-in more complexity.</p>

      <p>Unikernels promise fast boot times, small memory footprint and stronger
      security but lack in terms of manageability. Moreover, unikernels provide a
      non-generic environment for applications, with limited or no support for widely
      used libraries and OS features. This issue is even more apparent in the case of
      hardware acceleration. Acceleration libraries are often dynamically linked and
      have numerous dependencies, which directly contradict the statically linked
      notion of unikernels. Hardware acceleration functionality is almost
      non-existent in unikernel frameworks, mainly due to the absence of suitable
      virtualization solutions for such devices.
      ‚Äã
      In this talk, we present an update on the vAccel framework we have built that
      can expose hardware acceleration semantics to workloads running on isolated
      sandboxes. We go through the components that comprise the framework and
      elaborate on the challenges in building such a software stack: we first present
      an overview of vAccel and how it works; then we focus on the porting effort of
      vAccel in various unikernel frameworks. Finally, we present a hardware

      <p>It's the fall of 2021. Bidirectional charging (V2G) is a tech buzzword, but even all those EV owners whose cars support V2G have to wait for the industry to offer them optimal and automated operation.
      All of them? No. A small but growing group of Nissan Leaf owners are not waiting, but install a stack of open technologies in their home and live the new energy future.
      This talk will explain how HomeAssistant, FlexMeasures and NextCloud were put together to take a step into the future. In open source, we should build combined solutions from strong existing tools more often!
      We'll look at one year of data and discuss what could happen next.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Vehicle-to-grid charging (V2G), also referred to as bidirectional charging, means your car battery is not only drawing power from the grid, but might also discharge (back) into the grid.
      The consequences for the power system are highly consequential, but also from the user perspective: You can save a lot of money if you use your own solar power or use dynamic tariffs.
      Yet, commercial vendors are slow to offer optimized charging to households, let alone V2G. There are reasons for this, but we set out to show that they are not fundamentally technical.
      While the industry world is dragging their feet, the power and maturity of open source allowed us to put together an open stack to allow cost-optimized and automated bidirectional charging at home, with a user-friendly UX design built on top, as well. We used strong, existing tools, and added a thin application layer (a HomeAssistant plugin). This design approach should be on the table more often in the open-source community.
      We will explain the design of this stack, as well as the data we collected and potential monetary benefits for the user.
      At the moment, the stack is rolled out at the homes of other enthusiastic front-runners. This will make sure the solution becomes more mature and makes steps to scalability. As industry is also dragging their feet on supporting the OCPP protocol, we can only support one charger right now, the Wallbox Qasar, but there is no technical limit to supporting other bidirectional chargers. We are curious if others are interested to support more chargers, and make the stack even easier to install and monitor.
      Soon, the commercial world will roll out more bidirectional chargers and cars (we use the Nissan Leaf), as well as home energy management solutions which lock users into specific vendor relationships (where the car is just one of the managed services). It's crucial to provide an open-source alternative, to provide independence for users, and to inspire startups.</p>

Then, tissue is the minimalist issue tracker and project management system you've been waiting for!</p>

      <p>With tissue, you write issues as free-form text in gemtext files and commit them into the git repo of your project. tissue comes with an excellent Xapian based search interface that lets you search through these issues using very natural and powerful queries. tissue comes with an easily self-hosted web interface, and even helps you with building a static site to show off your project. State is evil. So, apart from the project git repo, tissue is stateless. The web interface does not require a database. This makes it easy to deploy, backup, and is at the right level of complexity for small free software projects.</p>

      <p>In this talk, through some examples and demos of PyScript, we will see how to use it - just include the CDN URL, understand that it is a frontend-only Python that runs on the browser and learn the fact that it can work with javascript in conjunction.</p>

      <p>After that, we will look at what is under the hood - Pyodide - which is a Python distribution for the browser. It is what is essential to power PyScript. We will discover what is the difference between using PyScript and Pyodide.</p>

      <p>Finally, we will conclude what is already available in PyScirpt like which library you can run on PyScript and which ones are still yet to come. In the end, we will answer the question - Will PyScript replace Django?</p>

      <p>This talk is for those who are curious about PyScript and the idea of running Python in the browser in general. We will assume no piror knowledge about it.</p>

      <p>Since the launch of Pyscript there are a lot of questions about what is it and how it works. Will it change how we do web development with Python? In this talk, we will go through what Pyscirpt actually is, and how it works (using compared Python libraries on Pyodides). We will also talk about why Pyscript is created - not to take over JavaScript or Django, but to give the rest of 99% of people access to Python.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we will also showcase how to use PyScript with JavaScript and/ or Django, hopefully, to inspire Python web developers to try it out.</p>

      <p>Over the last few years, the idea of a carbon aware, fossil free internet by 2030, has become more than just interesting idea, and instead something that is socially and economically plausible, as well as desirable and inline with the latest climate science.</p>

      <p>In this talk we‚Äôll cover some of the key drivers to make this possible, and what key policy changes can accelerate our transition from fossil fuels in the technology sector.</p>

      <p>We‚Äôll cover some of the most promising ideas from the Internet Architecture Board‚Äôs recent workshops to explore how to reduce global ICT emissions inline with the science around staying within 1.5 degrees of warming. We'll give an overview of how new open source software like Ecovisors can do for on-site power what hypervisors have done for virtualisation of computing, how carbon-aware Computing schedulers and carbon aware networking routers can lead to an internet that can complement a shift to a grid powered by more variable renewable sources of energy, and we will also cover how a shift to hourly carbon accounting for electricity with new standards like Energy Tag‚Äôs Granular Certificates can cut through existing greenwash.</p>

      <p>Finally we'll talk about some of the the regulatory drivers on the horizon can help technologists argue for more ambitious climate action, from the European Corporate Social Responsibility Directive to recent changes in international accounting standards from the IFRS (international financial reporting standards) Foundation.</p>

      <p>Participants will leave with a good grounding of the progress made in the Greening of IT, the challenges facing us for the rest of the decade, and better idea of their role in the coming energy transition, particularly in the tech sector.</p>

      <p>When creating a plugin system for a UI project, some of the questions one will undoubtedly have to answer are: What should we allow to be extended? What should the lifecycle of plugins be? How can developers test and distribute plugins?</p>

      <p>In this presentation we will share the issues and questions we faced when developing a plugin system for Headlamp, a Kubernetes UI project, and how we addressed them.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>UIs and their effectiveness can be very subjective. What works for some users will very likely not please many others.</p>

      <p>In Open Source, a full adaptation of a project to one's needs can be achieved by forking and modifying a project but that often results a massive effort to keep the fork or downstream changes close to upstream.</p>

      <p>An alternative to maintaining a fork can be a comprehensive plugin system. Such systems allow a project‚Äôs functionality to be extended via code that's dynamically loaded. Such extensions or plugins allow developers to isolate their changes and focus on them, thus avoiding having to fork and modifying the original project (or keeping changes to a minimum), and it becomes the base project maintainers' responsibility to keep the plugins working.</p>

      <p>JavaScript is a very flexible language to accomplish such extensions in a project by dynamically loading code, and React allows to reuse components in an isolated way, but developing a plugins system comes with many decisions and implications: What should we allow to be extended (and how)? When should we load plugins? What if they fail to load? What about the lifetime of plugins‚Äô React components? How to avoid bundling modules that will be available in the base project when plugins are loaded? How should end users run the plugins? How can they test the plugins?</p>

      <p>We had to figure out all these questions when developing Headlamp, a Kubernetes UI that can be run as a web or desktop app and was created to offer a generic UI in its core but allowing users to modify and brand it through plugins, instead of having to maintain a fork of it.</p>

      <p>In this presentation we will share how we addressed the questions around creating a plugin system: how we used webpack‚Äôs external modules to avoid bundling core modules, how we first shipped only type definitions of the libraries plugins use (and later decided we needed to ship the source code itself), how we created a helper script to bootstrap and keep updates under control, and many other considerations. Hopefully this will help early-stage projects keep these implications and possible solutions in mind when developing their own extension points. We‚Äôd also like to get others‚Äô perspectives and comments on what we could have done differently, in the Q&amp;A session.</p>

      <p>Many small to medium-sized open source projects depend on user donations for their primary source of funding.  Proper design of the funding webpage can have an outsized impact on whether your projects' end users decide to support your project financially.  Additionally, projects can easily pitch the funding ask too strenuously or not enough, leading to end user alienation and disengagement.</p>

      <p>Learn how to design an effective funding webpage that helps to grow your community and supports the long term viability of your project.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Talking about donations is slightly taboo in the FLOSS world.  But the biggest secret is that people who donate money are one of your projects' largest assets because their contribution links them tightly to your project's community (coders, writers, artists, translators, end-users and other people who donate).  By running an effective donation program, you are growing your community and strengthening the long term resilience of your project.</p>

      <p>Even if your project doesn't need the funding directly, building a funding program will build your project in other ways.  Funding contributed to your project is ideally contributed upstream to your supporting libraries.  This process links multiple members with open source contributions that they were not even aware were helping them.  And this process starts with effective design.</p>

      <p>This talk will cover</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Knowing the design consumer</li>
      <li>Where to place the donation page</li>
      <li>How to optimize the page for both engagement and ease of use</li>
      <li>Easy A/B testing without extra setup</li>
      <li>Building effective community with your donation page.</li>
      <li>Big red flags to avoid</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Additionally, this talk will give specific, concrete examples and results from the design process of the KiCad EDA suite's donation program.</p>

      <p>Many small to medium-sized open source projects depend on user donations for their primary source of funding.  Proper design of the funding webpage can have an outsized impact on whether your projects' end users decide to support your project financially.  Additionally, projects can easily pitch the funding ask too strenuously or not enough, leading to end user alienation and disengagement.</p>

      <p>Learn how to design an effective funding webpage that helps to grow your community and supports the long term viability of your project.</p>
    raw_description: |-
      <p>Talking about donations is slightly taboo in the FLOSS world.  But the biggest secret is that people who donate money are one of your projects' largest assets because their contribution links them tightly to your project's community (coders, writers, artists, translators, end-users and other people who donate).  By running an effective donation program, you are growing your community and strengthening the long term resilience of your project.</p>

      <p>Even if your project doesn't need the funding directly, building a funding program will build your project in other ways.  Funding contributed to your project is ideally contributed upstream to your supporting libraries.  This process links multiple members with open source contributions that they were not even aware were helping them.  And this process starts with effective design.</p>

      <p>This talk will cover</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Knowing the design consumer</li>
      <li>Where to place the donation page</li>
      <li>How to optimize the page for both engagement and ease of use</li>
      <li>Easy A/B testing without extra setup</li>
      <li>Building effective community with your donation page.</li>
      <li>Big red flags to avoid</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Additionally, this talk will give specific, concrete examples and results from the design process of the KiCad EDA suite's donation program.</p>

      <p>Sorting is one of the most common algorithms used in programming, and virtually every standard library contains a routine for it. Despite also being one of the oldest problems out there, surprisingly large improvements are still being found. Some of these are fundamental novelties, and others are optimizations matching the changing performance landscape in modern hardware.</p>

      <p>In this talk we present Glidesort, a general purpose in-memory stable comparison sort. It is fully adaptive to both pre-sorted runs in the data similar to Timsort, and low-cardinality inputs similar to Pattern-defeating Quicksort, making it to our knowledge the first practical stable sorting algorithm fully adaptive in both measures. Glidesort achieves a 3x speedup over a Rust‚Äôs standard library Timsort routine on sorting random 32-bit integers, with the speedup breaking the order of magnitude barrier for realistic low-cardinality distributions. It achieves this without the use of SIMD, processor-specific intrinsics or assumptions about the type being sorted: it is a fully generic sort taking an arbitrary comparison operator.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Using Glidesort as the motivating example we discuss the principles of efficient stable in-memory partitioning and merging on modern hardware. In particular attention is paid to eliminating branches and interleaving independent parallel loops to efficiently use our modern deeply-pipelined superscalar processors. The lessons learned here are widely applicable to efficient data processing outside of sorting.</p>

      <p>We also go into more detail on the various intricacies that Glidesort has to overcome in our Rust implementation. In particular how to deal with splitting and concatenating slices in a safe manner using GhostCell-style branding, the problems faced when dealing with panics in the comparison operator, and potential issues with interior mutability in comparison operators.</p>

      <p>Slurm is the most widely used batch scheduler for HPC systems. The Open Source Software community
      is very active in the development surrounding the Slurm ecosystem, contributing CLI tools for accounting, monitoring, and notebooks among others. A lot of these client environments are nowadays created on containers, which have become a ubiquitous part of running applications.
      However, this way of working provides new challenges in HPC environments, especially when using Slurm.
      Slurm requires careful management of shared cluster secrets and cluster-wide configuration files that need to be in sync in order to work efficiently and securely.
      This talk proposes a novel and simple tool called straw, which allows the creation of secret-less and config-less Slurm client environments. Therefore simplifying the creation of (containerised) environments by removing the burdens of maintaining config files, sensitive munge secrets, and additional daemons.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>This talk will first provide an introduction to Slurm, followed by a description (mostly drawing from personal experience) of common patterns and pitfalls when creating containers that interact with Slurm clusters for different purposes (monitoring, notebooks, etc).
      Next, I will introduce Straw, explaining why it was needed and why despite its simplicity (it mostly just fetches a bunch of config files), it is able to perform a task that regular Slurm tools can't, therefore simplifying Slurm client environments.
      Finally, I will conclude by showing a simple example of how the tool can be used, and how it compares to the usual scenarios in which config files, extra daemons, and secrets need to be carefully managed.
      If time allows it, I might detail some of the weaknesses of this approach: the fact that the Slurm protocol isn't really documented, and therefore this tool relies on "reverse-engineering" (as much as one can say reverse engineering when no documentation exists, but the code is available) to keep up with new Slurm releases.</p>

After running my company for 5 years on entirely free software I think this is not the case. We have instant communication, shared calendars, groupware, single sign on, and a single administration interface! Things have worked out really well and in many ways are better integrated than trying to combine multiple different cloud based services.</p>

All the TG discussions happen in the open and all the related reference implementations are open source, representing a unique opportunity for interested contributors to participate in the elaboration of such a fundamental piece of technology.</p>

      <p>During this presentation we will describe the currently proposed architecture, highlighting how it is focusing on multi-tenant, hardware-virtualized workloads. We will also explain how both the guest and host APIs will support this architecture by stepping through a few concrete confidential computing use cases. Next we will present <a href="https://github.com/rivosinc/salus/">Salus</a>, the reference Trusted Security Manager (TSM) implementation. The last part of this talk will go into the short and longer term tasks the TG is going to tackle, like e.g. trusted IO and attestation. During this last section, we will try to highlight where and how new contributors could help the RISC-V community design and implement this confidential computing architecture.</p>

      <p>CorTexT Platform is the digital platform of the Interdisciplinary Laboratory for Science, Innovation and Society (LISIS) held in Paris. This platform aims at empowering open research and studies in social sciences about the dynamic of science, technology, innovation and knowledge production. It covers a large variety of methodological research fields, such as scientometrics, Social Networks Analysis, Natural Language Processing and spatial analysis. Its web application gathers most of the original methods produced by the platform team members (https://www.cortext.net/members/).
      Twelve years after its creation, CorTexT Manager is facing a growth of its usages: in number of users, type of institutions, and locations of the users. Back in 2021, more than 1300 active users came to analyze data on it, producing more than 66 000 calculations, from a wide variety of organizations (laboratories, government agencies, firms, newspapers...) located in 60 countries across the world. In 2019, our users were coming from 39 different countries. In the meantime, scientific production published using one or more sets of methods accessible through CorTexT Manager has nearly doubled: a total of 67 scientific documents citing or mentioning CorText Manager has been identified for 2021 (https://www.cortext.net/publications/).
      Addressing these changes has required significant transformations of CorTexT Manager: both for its technical infrastructure as well as for how its codebase is produced and its academic visibility. This presentation will give a brief overview of what is CorTexT Manager and focus on: the importance of user documentation for scientific reproducibility, questions related to the ownership and copyright of the source code when engineers and developers are supported by multiple research organizations, and how to ensure its academic visibility.</p>

      <p>The Digital Public Good Standard is fast approaching its two-year anniversary. The Digital Public Good Alliance (DPGA) has built a registry of Open Source solutions and tools that address the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. But how do we know whether a DPG itself is sustainable? To date, we still don‚Äôt have a common way of measuring or knowing whether a DPG has what it takes to succeed and scale for different use cases. The variable for time remains unsolved in the current DPG equation.</p>

      <p>For folks who participate in the funding and development of DPGs, how can we build better DPGs with open and inclusive communities? Are there pitfalls to avoid or key lessons to follow? Justin &amp; Vipul will explore the life cycle of a DPG and why building in the open earlier builds better DPGs. This talk will look at DPGs and DPG nominees in different phases of development: early-stage, mid-stage, and late-stage.</p>

      <p>The Digital Public Good Standard is fast approaching its two-year anniversary. The Digital Public Good Alliance (DPGA) has built a registry of Open Source solutions and tools that address the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. But how do we know whether a DPG itself is sustainable? To date, we still don‚Äôt have a common way of measuring or knowing whether a DPG has what it takes to succeed and scale for different use cases. The variable for time remains unsolved in the current DPG equation.</p>

      <p>For folks who participate in the funding and development of DPGs, how can we build better DPGs with open and inclusive communities? Are there pitfalls to avoid or key lessons to follow? Justin &amp; Vipul will explore the life cycle of a DPG and why building in the open earlier builds better DPGs. This talk will look at DPGs and DPG nominees in different phases of development: early-stage, mid-stage, and late-stage.</p>

      <p>By now you‚Äôve surely heard of Kotlin Multiplatform, and maybe tried it out in a demo. Maybe you‚Äôve even integrated some shared code into a production app. If you have, you know that there are many subtle complications that come up when you want to ship shared Kotlin code. This includes things like modularization, translating between Kotlin and Swift, managing multiple repositories that depend on each other, and optimizing build times and binary sizes. It‚Äôs not as easy as it looks when you write your first ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù!</p>

      <p>At Touchlab, we‚Äôve been involved with Kotlin Multiplatform since the very beginning, and we‚Äôve learned a thing or two along the way about what does and doesn‚Äôt work well. Come hear about how we‚Äôve solved some of these difficulties to ship Multiplatform code across all sorts of organizations and environments, so you‚Äôre ready to use KMP in the real world.</p>

      <p>Bottlerocket is a free and open source Linux distribution purpose-built for hosting
      containers. Since its launch in 2020, Bottlerocket has been adopted by companies
      large and small as a platform for running their containerized workloads in production.</p>

      <p>It has only what you need to run containers reliably, and is built with standard
      open source components. Bottlerocket-specific additions focus on reliable
      updates and on its management and configuration API.</p>

      <p>Some notable features include:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>API access for configuring your system</li>
      <li>Fast and reliable image-based system updates</li>
      <li>Defense-in-depth protections such as a read only root filesystem, minimized attack surface, and more</li>
      <li>Built in integration with container orchestration platforms</li>
      </ul>


      <p>This talk will provide an overview of Bottlerocket, covering some of the
      benefits of using a container-optimized OS. We will cover how
      Bottlerocket is similar to general purpose Linux distributions and point out
      the ways it is different. During the talk we'll get hands on and show what it
      is like to use and administer Bottlerocket nodes. We will provide all the
      details on how to get involved and participate in the community. We'd love
      for you to join the Bottlerocket open source project</p>

      <p>While Compose is easy to adopt, not creating legacy code right at the start of such a journey requires extra planning, awareness, and, most importantly, testing. We'll have a look at how we can test pure Compose UIs as well as hybrid ones that have Views and composables too.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we'll learn what the semantics tree is, its relation to the composition, how we can manipulate it in composables using the Semantics modifier, how we can implement composables with testability in mind, and how we can test pure Compose, and hybrid UIs.</p>

      <p>The reconciliation pattern is a design pattern that is commonly used in Kubernetes to ensure that the desired state of a system is consistently maintained.

Reconciliation is one of the key patterns that emerge from control theory, which is a branch of engineering that deals with the design and analysis of systems that control the behavior of dynamic processes.
      Reconcilers are the heart of Kubernetes and Cluster API. The use of reconcilers in Kubernetes enables users to define the desired state of their clusters declaratively, and let Kubernetes handle the details of implementing and maintaining that state. The reconciliation pattern in Go is implemented by using the Kubernetes API to track the state of the cluster, and Go's concurrency features to ensure that the reconciler runs continuously and can make adjustments in real time.
      We will take a look into the implementation of these patterns in their nascent form and then their extension in Cluster API by the use of controllers.</p>

      <p>One of the greatest obstacles to implementing FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) research practices,  is the lack of awareness about what solutions are available across disciplines. Furthermore, most of the discussions around FAIR, Open and Good Data practices, as well as the solutions and requirements, occur at a higher level, distanced from the researchers who are the ultimate end-users of the solutions.</p>

      <p>To bridge this gap, we launched FAIRPoints-an event series highlighting pragmatic measures developed by the wider research community towards the implementation of the FAIR data principles https://www.fairpoints.org/.<br/>
      Our goal is to bring together; the research community- the ultimate user and producer of data, policy and decision makers- shapers of research practices, and the broader research support populace- to aid in the development of solutions for better Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reuse by providing a platform for conversations to take place around realistic and pragmatic FAIR implementations</p>

      <p>While containerization revolutionized the delivery and execution of software, it introduces new challenges as the usual practice with one big software file-system with a subsequent <code>module load</code> to rule all environments is not feasable with containers.
      The talk introduces <em>MetaHub Registry</em>, an OCI compliant container registry to serve  environment/hardware specific images and reduce overall complexity of herding all the container images. By using profiles when logging in MetaHub is aware of the context the image is going to be executed and picks the right image from previously pushed/configured container images. Centralising the logic of picking the right software variant (<code>module load</code>) within the registry enables a series of enhancements to the user experience and a reduction in complexity which allows users and admins to focus on their science.</p>

      <p>CHERI defines hardware extensions to encode access constraints on pointers, enabling hardware enforcement of such restructions based on metadata stored alongside pointers. There is an ongoing drive to support compiling Rust code in a way that can make use of these extensions.</p>

      <p>Doing this provides another layer of protection. We can encode knowledge about provenance validity, bounds and other access restrictions that the compiler (and OS/etc.) knows about in a way the hardware can enforce at runtime. The Rust memory model is famous for being able to enforce these types of restrictions at compile time, but not for unsafe Rust code. Unsafe Rust code needs to be written sometimes, which presents situations which can only be verified at run time. Some other nice benefits could come from this work. For example, runtime bounds checking can now be done by hardware rather than software, and since provenance information is necessary for operations on capabilities, closing gaps where it is not currently preserved forms a part of this work.</p>

      <p>This talk is a discussion on what is required for this support, and gives an overview of the state of the various attempts to implement this support.</p>

      <p><a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">Pydantic</a> is a data validation library for Python that has seen massive adoption over the last few years - it is estimated that Pydantic is now used by about 10% of professional web developers!</p>

      <p>Over the last year I've been working full time to rebuild Pydantic from the ground up, using Rust for virtually all the validation and serialization logic. Pydantic V2, with these changes included, will be released early in 2023.</p>

      <p>In this talk I will give a brief introduction to Pydantic V2 before diving into how the use of Rust has allowed us to completely change the architecture of Pydantic to make it easier to extend and maintain while also improving performance significantly.</p>

      <p>The majority of the talk will be devoted to using examples from the pydantic V2 code base (rust and python) to demonstrate the advantages (and disadvantages) of writing libraries like Pydantic in Rust.</p>

      <p>This talk should be interesting to any Rust or Python developer who's interested in combining the two languages - no knowledge of Python or Pydantic is required. However if you'd like to get some context or learn more about the topics discussed, here are some useful resources:
      * <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/blog/pydantic-v2/">Pydantic V2 Plan</a> - blog post about the plan for Pydantic V2
      * <a href="https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core">pydantic-core</a> - the python package that provides Rust logic in pydantic
      * <a href="https://pyo3.rs/">PyO3 docs</a> - the amazing library that allows Rust to be embedded in Python
      * <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FolV-xUD3Ko">Build your Python Extensions with Rust! by Paul Ganssle</a> - good intro to building Python extensions in Rust</p>

      <p><a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">Pydantic</a> is a data validation library for Python that has seen massive adoption over the last few years - it is estimated that Pydantic is now used by about 10% of professional web developers!</p>

      <p>Over the last year I've been working full time to rebuild Pydantic from the ground up, using Rust for virtually all the validation and serialization logic. Pydantic V2, with these changes included, will be released early in 2023.</p>

      <p>In this talk I will give a brief introduction to Pydantic V2 before diving into how the use of Rust has allowed us to completely change the architecture of Pydantic to make it easier to extend and maintain while also improving performance significantly.</p>

      <p>The majority of the talk will be devoted to using examples from the pydantic V2 code base (rust and python) to demonstrate the advantages (and disadvantages) of writing libraries like Pydantic in Rust.</p>

      <p>This talk should be interesting to any Rust or Python developer who's interested in combining the two languages - no knowledge of Python or Pydantic is required. However if you'd like to get some context or learn more about the topics discussed, here are some useful resources:
      * <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/blog/pydantic-v2/">Pydantic V2 Plan</a> - blog post about the plan for Pydantic V2
      * <a href="https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core">pydantic-core</a> - the python package that provides Rust logic in pydantic
      * <a href="https://pyo3.rs/">PyO3 docs</a> - the amazing library that allows Rust to be embedded in Python
      * <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FolV-xUD3Ko">Build your Python Extensions with Rust! by Paul Ganssle</a> - good intro to building Python extensions in Rust</p>

      That has been such success, that SUSE, Red Hat, Canonical (Ubuntu), AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux have joint also. The question has poppeed up, whether we should be restrictly open only for all Linux Distributions or should we include also important upstream projects in our Linux Distributions Working Group. In this presentation we will represent the existing benetif for all Linux distributions and go into detail, which (base) upstream projects should be included/invited and why. Finally, we want to receive feedback during the Q&amp;A session with a discussion, how we should proceed with this idea.</p>

      <p>What happens when you have access to large clusters, but have little control over the software installed on the machines? Unfortunately, this is the current scenario that researchers often find in HPC clusters, which include very old software stack, a brittle environment and non-cooperative sysadmins. We have been experimenting with Nix to provide an up-to-date system running on top of the already existing software, without root permissions with the help of user namespaces.</p>

      <p>In this talk we give a tour on the problems we found and how we solved them:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Starting from the installation and configuration of nix to be used by multiple users when we lack a shared <code>/nix</code> store.</li>
      <li>Avoiding library contamination from <code>/usr/lib</code> with an isolated root mount</li>
      <li>Interactive development while compiling the code inside the isolated environment with a patched nix-portable</li>
      <li>Adding custom compilers to the stdenv</li>
      <li>Building packages tuned to an specific CPU with vectorization optimizations in mind.</li>
      <li>Running the benchmarks with SLURM inside the isolated environment with multiple compute nodes.</li>
      <li>Improving MPI fast zero-copy transfer inside user namespaces.</li>

      <p>Biased locking was removed from OpenJDK HotSpot JVM some time ago. This move had its reasons, but it resulted in a number of significant performance degradations in existing code. Thus, when non-contended locking optimization can be added, it still benefits virtual machines. Parallel stop-the-world garbage collection is one of the earliest GC variants in HotSpot, and yet it is the best choice in terms of high throughput.
      SubstrateVM which powers GraalVM native image supports synchronization monitors and offers serial stop-the-world GC as a basic collector. Due to the increased popularity of pre-compilation and its support in modern frameworks, it is remarkable how playing classical optimization pieces helps to improve the performance of such code.
      BellSoft recently put locking and garbage collection enhancements for public review. It is interesting that within GraalVM project both were implemented in Java. We'll explore implementation details, benchmark results, and application benefits.</p>

      <p>The European Commission‚Äôs Open Source Observatory (OSOR) Team will present the Interoperable Europe Act (IEA) and its implications for the free and open source software ecosystem. The text, which the European Commission adopted as a proposal in November 2022, aims to reinforce the cross-border interoperability of the public sector in the EU. Practically, it aims to facilitate ‚Äúthe co-creation of an ecosystem of interoperability solutions across the EU‚Äù.</p>

      <p>To achieve this, the regulation sets up a two-layer governance structure (the Interoperable Europe Board and the Interoperable Europe Community), with both entities expected to work closely with open source experts, institutions and companies.</p>

      <p>This session will in particular dig into the mechanisms meant to enable the sharing and reuse of interoperability solutions between public administrations.</p>

      <p>GNU Guix is our beloved reproducible software deployment toolbox.  It is a package manager also able to create isolated computational environments.  It is even able to produce pack containers.  Or, it can be a complete system.  In addition of focusing on reproducibility, it provides some key features as roll-back, declarative configuration, or time-machine, to name some.  GNU Guix respects the four essential freedoms: run the program as you wish; study how the program works and change it for computing as you wish; share copies for helping others; distribute modified versions for improving.</p>

      <p>Open science considers that scientific practices must be more open, transparent, collaborative and inclusive, coupled with more accessible and verifiable scientific knowledge subject to scrutiny and critique.  Such enterprise will improve the quality, reproducibility and impact of science, and thereby the reliability of the evidence needed for robust decision-making and policy and increased trust in science.  Quoting UNESCO.</p>

      <p>Wait, Guix and Open science seems so well matched.  This presentation is an attempt to illustrate how the Guix project is helping Open science.  We emphasize two features of Guix that implement Open science principles: transparent and long-term.</p>

      <p>This is not really a "how-to" -- it's more of a "what-did"</p>

      <p>I spent an unreasonable amount of time writing a software 3D renderer for an extremely small and low-power ESP32 device running MicroPython. I will talk about the problems I encountered, the optimisations I made, and the eventual contributions I was able to make back to the MicroPython project.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>If you've been to other hacker conferences like EMFCamp or MCH, you may be familiar with the tradition giving attendees interesting hardware on a lanyard instead of a traditional conference badge. Attendees are encouraged to experiment with and hack on the device both at the conference and afterwards.</p>

      <p>This year at EMFCamp 2022, the conference badge was a USB thumb drive sized ESP32 device running MicroPython. It has a joystick, an accelerometer, the cutest little LiPo battery, and a lovely 135x240 pixel colour TFT display. It seemed like it would be a fun single-weekend exercise to write a little 3D renderer for it in Python.</p>

      <p>It turned out to be a "fun" multi-weekend exercise, but I learned a lot that I'd like to share. I learned how to workaround problems in the tooling. I learned there were problems in the display driver. I learned about optimising Python. I learned how to write native MicroPython modules to rewrite some hot functions in C. I learned about optimising how the Python talks to the C. And I even learned how to contribute some improvements back to the MicroPython project.</p>

      <p>I will bring the device with me, catch me after the talk to see it rendering Utah teapots up close.</p>

      <p>Unikernels are specialized, single-address-space machine images built from library operating systems.
      They shrink the attack surface and resource footprint of cloud services.
      Applications that are compiled into unikernels are able to boot virtual machines.
      Using library operating systems enables static analysis of the image's whole software stack: from the kernel to the application.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we present the transition from the C-based HermitCore to the Rust-based RustyHermit unikernel.
      Using Rust's build system, the unikernel is split into components, whereby the end-user is able to specialize the application and the resulting boot image.
      QEMU's microvm virtual platform and Firecracker are lightweight virtual machines (microVMs), which are specialized for cloud environments.
      We show the benefits of the component-based architecture to build specialized applications for microVMs.
      Minimalistic design of unikernels and microVMs reduce the memory footprint and the attack surface of the complete software stack and build an ideal base for cloud services.</p>

    subtitle: User-friendly Lightweight TPM Remote Attestation over Bluetooth

      <p>Ultrablue (User-friendly Lightweight TPM Remote Attestation over Bluetooth) is a solution to allow individual users to perform boot state attestation with their phone. It consists in a server, running on a computer, acting as the attester, and a graphical client application, running on a trusted phone, acting as the verifier.</p>

      <p>A typical use-case is to verify the integrity of your bootchain before unlocking your computer, to prevent offline attacks on an unattended laptop. It can also serve as a debugging tool for secure boot issues after firmware upgrades or as a second factor for disk encryption.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>During the boot of a PC, it is now common to have each stage store measurements of the next one into a TPM, in order to keep a tamper-proof log of the boot chain. Those measurements are then leveraged to seal secrets, eg. a disk encryption key, or to report the state of the device to a remote server in cryptographically secure way, using a procedure known as remote attestation.</p>

      <p>Remote attestation has slowly gained traction over the last few years, most notably among cloud providers such as Azure, to guard access to online resources. It is also a key element in validating dynamic root-of-trust measurements (DRTM), which reduce the trusted computing base compared to traditional UEFI-based boot chains, but require a trusted third-party to validate the final state of the system. Unfortunately, little progress has been made recently to enable individual users without access to server resources to reap the benefits of remote attestation. This is particularly frustrating considering that almost everybody carries a small trusted server with them all the time: smartphones.</p>

      <p>Building upon an idea by Matthew Garrett <a href="Linux">1</a>, we introduce Ultrablue (User-friendly Lightweight TPM Remote Attestation over Bluetooth), a solution to securely inspect and validate a TPM event log from a phone. Ultrablue consists of a command-line attester, running on a computer, and an Android graphical application, running on a trusted phone, communicating over encrypted Bluetooth low-energy (BLE). Pairing the phone and computer is made easier and more secure through the use of a QR Code. After a trust-on-first-use provisioning phase to enroll the computer on the phone, the phone can check that the boot chain has not been compromised in later boots. Sample scripts and a self-contained virtual machine are also provided as a reference of how to integrate Ultrablue in the boot process to guard disk encryption by a secret delivered by the phone.</p>

      <p>Future work includes improving the user interface to inspect and validate unexpected event logs, adding support for more versatile verification policies, and integrating Ultrablue into existing hardened systems such as Safeboot (safeboot.net).</p>

      <p>The Ultrablue project has been developped at ANSSI (ssi.gouv.fr) by Lo√Øc Falkau--Buckwell, under the supervision of Nicolas Bouchinet and Gabriel Kerneis.</p>

    raw_abstract: "<p>Cloud and Open Source have a very intricate relationship! In
      this talk we will look at the history of how the impact of Cloud on Open Source
      changed through the years, examine the current state as well as make a case
      for a particular way to use Cloud and Open Source Together. If you cherish the
      values of Open Source - you will do well by using Cloud as Commodity Infrastructure
      Provider and run Open Source Software on top of it. Consider Kubernetes in particular
      as your API of choice with its ubiquitous availability among all major public
      cloud providers and private cloud software vendors. We will show what while
      this ecosystem may not be as mature as proprietary solution from cloud vendors
      it is moving rapidly and becoming a great fit for more and more situations.</p>"

      <p>Currently, the energy consumption metrics are only available at node levels. There is no way to obtain container-level energy consumption. Autoscalers and schedulers really need pod-level metrics data in order to obtain energy savings from resizing or migrating containers.</p>

      <p>The presentation introduces Kubernetes-based Efficient Power Level Exporter (Kepler) and its integration with Kubernetes. By leveraging eBPF programs, Kepler probes per container energy consumption related system counters and exports them as metrics. These metrics help end users observe their containers‚Äô energy consumption and allow cluster admins to make intelligent decisions on achieving energy conservation goals. The presentation shows that Kepler can be easily integrated into Prometheus and render time series metrics into Grafana.</p>

      <p>At last, we will demonstrate sustainable management of clusters by leveraging Cloud-native patterns, Observability and Kubernetes features like node selector, node labels, node name, affinity and anti-affinity to achieve carbon intensity aware placement of workloads in a Kubernetes cluster.</p>

      of Reverse Polish Lisp on modern calculator platforms</p>"
    description: |-
      <p>In 1986, Hewlett-Packard introduced the HP28C, and with it, a new programming language, "Reverse Polish Lisp" (RPL). This was arguably one of the most powerful programming languages ever introduced on a pocket calculator, and it continued well into the 2000's, with the HP50 series. RPL was initially designed for a machine with a 4-bit CPU and 2K of memory, soon upgraded to 32K. Some of the more recent calculators from Hewlett-Packard used ARM CPUs, but then only to emulate the original 4-bit CPU and run the older 4-bit ROM code.</p>

      <p>Today, several ARM-based calculator platforms support open-source firmware. This opens the possibility to revive RPL in a more modern environment. DB48X is an attempt at recreating RPL from scratch to run on such platforms. Even today, these machines remain minimalistic, with as little as 60K of free memory and less than 1MB of usable Flash storage, for example. This talk will present a design and implementation of a basic RPL runtime written in C++, but replacing the standard C++ object model with a compact, garbage-collected, byte-addressable representation of RPL objects. We will also dive into what RPL is, why it truly deserves the name "Lisp", and why it remains remarkably different from the Lisp most of us are familiar with. We will discuss some of the implemented and planned features for that new iteration of RPL, including built-in on-line help, taking advantage of high-resolution graphics, or making it as efficient as possible in "direct" (non-programmed) mode.</p>

      <p>This talk gives an overview about the state of Lanzaboote, a set of tools that enable Secure Boot for NixOS.</p>

      <p>UEFI Secure Boot is a firmware security feature that prevents untrusted code from booting on a system. Users can utilize this technology to prevent certain kinds of attacks that involve booting malicious code on their computers. Unfortunately, NixOS has no support for Secure Boot yet.</p>

      <p>The talk will give a short background of Secure Boot, go through NixOS-specific challenges, and explain the strategy we took for enabling Secure Boot in NixOS. We will highlight the newly developed components, such as a custom UEFI boot stub and companion Linux userspace tool, which are both written in Rust. Finally, we will explain the current state of upstreaming Secure Boot support in NixOS.</p>

      <p>Traditionally, web applications are built as monoliths. Complex applications are typically organized into smaller packages, but these are still bundled and built together as part of the given application deployment. Micro-frontends allow developers to break out from this model by allowing a single web application to be split into multiple projects that are built, deployed and updated separately and served from different web -servers but still able to seamlessly integrate with the given application.Large projects tend to have lots of teams and collaborators working on different parts of the same application within the same code repository. Managing and coordinating releases can be difficult, since everyone involved with the project works towards the same release schedule.</p>

      <p>Providing support for mainstream applications is fundamental for a new/custom

      through the development of a compatibility layer, currently an ad-hoc and
      unoptimized process that involves a vast amount of unnecessary engineering
      effort. There is a need for efficient methods to measure precisely what
      OS features are really required by a given set of target applications,

    description: |-
      <p>In this talk I will present a streamlined methodology to optimize the
      development of the OS features required to build a compatibility layer in order
      to support a set of target applications, focusing on the system calls of the
      Linux ABI. To avoid engineering effort overestimation, we rely on dynamic
      analysis. The methodology revolves around a tool called Loupe that measures,
      for every system call invoked by an application processing an input workload
      (e.g. benchmark, test suite, etc.), which ones really need to be implemented
      and which ones can be faked/stubbed/partially implemented. Given a set of
      applications and input workloads, Loupe can compute for a given OS an optimized
      compatibility layer development plan, aiming to support as many applications as
      possible, as early as possible. We analyze Loupe's measurements over a wide
      (100+) set of applications, and demonstrate in particular that the effort
      needed to provide compatibility is significantly lower than that determined by
      previous works using static analysis: our study shows that as much as 40-60\%
      of system calls found in application code are not even needed to successfully
      run meaningful workloads and even full test suites.</p>

      possible, as early as possible. We analyze Loupe's measurements over a wide
      (100+) set of applications, and demonstrate in particular that the effort
      needed to provide compatibility is significantly lower than that determined by
      previous works using static analysis: our study shows that as much as 40-60\%
      of system calls found in application code are not even needed to successfully
      run meaningful workloads and even full test suites.</p>

      <p>Over the pandemic years, conference organizers have had a crash course in running online events, but now that the world is returning to normality, they're under pressure to keep the on-line portion of the conference for a hybrid remote/local event.  Linux Plumbers Conference is a usually in-person event that specializes in direct in-person interactions as well as more traditional presentations.  This year was the first time we tried to take our on-line infrastructure and repurpose it for hybrid in Dublin in September.  One of the big factors in running a hybrid conference is that it's no longer just the committee and a server farm, you have a venue, a local audio team, an external A/V handler and the technology all to plumb into a seamless experience.</p>

      <p>Plumbers online was based on BigBlue Button and Matrix, which is what we also used for hybrid.  This presentation will be the story of how it was put together, how the in-person and local components were designed to interact, how it worked in the field and, although plumbers received universal acclaim for being one of the most successful hybrid conferences, the many things that went wrong during the conference and how we surmounted, or at least worked around, them.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Our technology infrastructure was set up identically to virtual: BigBlue Button (BBB) handling the audio/video but with the in BBB chat element replaced by matrix.  The reason we have an external A/V company in the mix above is because we've always done streaming from the in-person conference, and this was planned to be our free tier of the conference; view the stream and be able to interact with the room chat over matrix.  We've discussed before [1] the scaling problems of this setup (and so won't go over scaling in this presentation), but we'd fixed this in virtual and had no scaling issues in hybrid.  Of great importance to getting the interaction to function was audience training.  We used the same methodology for virtual (essentially only unmute your video if you want to interject) and hybrid, so we already had the on-line training ready to go.</p>

      <p>Part of the on=site issues were caused by the steep learning curve the external A/V company had to go through to manage the room BBB console as well as getting the in room sound setup correct (onsite audio isn't used to having a remote feed, but they can be persuaded to treat it like an audio feed from the presenter).  Our biggest problem actually turned out to be the size of our onsite committee tech team (2 people) which was insufficient to the number of live rooms (six) we were running.</p>

      <p>We manage a 200TB glusterfs cluster in production. While we were managing this, we learnt some key points. In this session, we will share with you:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>What are the minimal health checks that are needed for a glusterfs volume, to ensure high availability and consistency</li>
      <li>What are the problems with the current cluster expansion steps(rebalance) in glusterfs we experienced? How did we manage to avoid the need for a rebalancing of data, for our use-case. Proof of concept for new rebalance algo for future.</li>
      <li>How are we scheduling our maintenance activities such that we never have downtime even if the things go wrong.</li>
      <li>How did we reduce the time to replace a node from weeks to a day.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>As the number of clients increased we had to scale the system to handle the increasing load, here are our learnings scaling glusterfs</p>

      <ul>
      <li>How to profile glusterfs to find performance bottlenecks.</li>
      <li>Why client-io-threads feature didn't work for us? How we improved applications to achieve 4x throughput by scaling mounts instead.</li>
      <li>How to Improve the incremental heal speed and patches contributed to upstream</li>
      <li>Road map for glusterfs based on these findings</li>

    abstract: <p>MOTIS is a modular mobility platform that was released as Open Source
      in May 2020. It's main functionality is its high performance door to door routing.
      However, MOTIS comes with "batteries included" and provides additional modules
      for input (e.g. auto-complete for station names and addresses) and output (embedded
      map tile server, departure and arrival tables, vehicle locations, etc.) as well
      as an Android app and web user interface (all open source). MOTIS offers a JSON-API
      via HTTP(S). It reads timetables in GTFS and can update its data model with
      GTFS-RT. Our current focus is the profile-based computation of fully accessible
      routes for people with disabilities as well as the implementation of a data
      model and algorithms that can efficiently work with timetables of arbitrary
      length.</p>

      <p>The devres resource management system in the linux kernel has been blamed for use-after-free bugs triggered from user-space via device files.

      <p>We will also discuss linux kernel frameworks that already deal with this problem, how they do it and how vulnerable subsystems can be improved.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Devres is a simple resource management system commonly used in linux device drivers. It's based on creating a linked list of various resources associated with given device. Managed resources can be acquired during the life-time of a device (typically when the device is probed after being bound to a driver) and will get released when the driver is detached from the device - be it on .probe() error or after .remove() returns.</p>

      <p>On multiple occasions, devres has been blamed for use-after-free bugs that can be triggered from user-space in several subsystems. A simple way to trigger those bugs in vulnerable subsystems is to: open a device file, unbind the driver from the device and call any of the system calls relevant for this device.</p>

      <p>While those bugs do exist, I believe devres has nothing to do with them, rather they are caused by managing resources with devres that should survive the driver unbind and instead live for as long as the underlying struct device's reference count does not drop down to 0. This talk will present detailed explanation and examples.</p>

      <p>Devres is actually an easy way to simplify error paths and REDUCE resource leaks and memory bugs. There is only a limited number of use-cases where devres must not be used and for most cases it can be hidden behind the subsystem's APIs. The aversion to devres that certain maintainers express is unjustified and this talk aims at changing people's minds.</p>

      <p>In this talk I will give an overview of the largest hack of the internet (aka. hole punching), dive into learnings running it on IPFS (~50_000 nodes) and finally present the data collected through our measurement campaign.</p>

      <p>By design, OSv has always been a "fat" unikernel and by default has provided a large subset of <code>glibc</code> functionality and has included full standard C++ library (<code>libstdc++</code>), the ZFS implementation, drivers for many devices, and has supported many hypervisors. On one hand, it makes running arbitrary applications on any hypervisor very easy using a single universal kernel. On another hand, such universality comes with the price of the bloated kernel with many symbols and drivers and possibly ZFS unused, thus causing inefficient memory usage, longer boot time, and potential security vulnerabilities. In addition, the C++ applications linked against a version of libstdc++ different than the version the kernel was linked against, may simply not work.</p>

      <p>In this presentation, I will talk about enhancements in the new release 0.57 to address these issues. More specifically, I will focus on a new experimental build mode to hide the non-<code>glibc</code> symbols and <code>libstdc++</code> and extract ZFS code out of the kernel in form of a dynamically linked library. I will also explain another new build option to tailor the kernel to a set of specific device drivers - 'driver profiles', and another new mechanism to allow building a version of the kernel with a subset of glibc symbols needed to support a specific application.</p>

      <p>Finally, I will also cover other interesting improvements and optimizations like "lazy" stack, minimal netlink support, and novel ways to build and run ZFS images.</p>

      <p>Schema changes at scale must keep the data accessible and cannot block any clients from using a table. TiDB, a distributed MySQL compatible database, solves this by transitioning through compatible states, so clients can transition to the new state asynchronously and continue to use the data.</p>

      <p>PingCAP, the developers of TiDB, has evolved the schema changes implementation to be both faster and more tuneable, which will be shown in the presentation.</p>
    raw_description: "<p>The presentation will explain things like why a delete only
      state is needed, also how something like REORGANIZE PARTITION can be executed
      online without blocking. New development like generating and ingesting SST files
      for speeding up data reorganization for ADD INDEX and distributing the data
      reorganization load.</p>"

      <p>It's been almost 10 years since the demonstration of the earliest Docker client at PyCon in 2013. While container capabilities and tooling existed prior to Docker, we can all agree that the last 10 years has seen an explosion of tools, integrations, and production services all built on container runtime technologies similar to that early Docker engine project.</p>

      <p>Given that context, it's a good time to look around and survey the landscape of container developer tooling in use today. While Docker engine, and the companion Docker Desktop product are widely used, the creation of the OCI standards and the launching of the CNCF has allowed for a wide array of tools and projects that also provide developers tools and capabilities to create, build, and run containers and interoperate with container registries. In this talk we'll tour the current world of open source developer tools, including podman, the early simple containerd clients, nerdctl, and the advent of non-Linux platform support built alongside these tools, such as Rancher Desktop, Lima/colima, Finch, and Podman Desktop.</p>

      <p>An AI that can lock you out of your own PC every hour or so, and only allow you back in when you did 10 pushups.</p>

      <p>It sounded like a good idea before I actually made it.</p>

      <p>What better way to learn about MLOps than over-engineering a pet project to a degree where Google can put it into production tomorrow.
      Using a raspberry pi coupled with a camera / AI accelerator combo kit, I created a fully featured fitness overlord. The full ML pipeline was handled with ClearML, using a Google Pose Estimation model at its core, both open source ofcourse.</p>

      <p>An AI that can lock you out of your own PC every hour or so, and only allow you back in when you did 10 pushups.</p>

      <p>It sounded like a good idea before I actually made it.</p>

      <p>What better way to learn about MLOps than over-engineering a pet project to a degree where Google can put it into production tomorrow.
      Using a raspberry pi coupled with a camera / AI accelerator combo kit, I created a fully featured fitness overlord. The full ML pipeline was handled with ClearML, using a Google Pose Estimation model at its core, both open source ofcourse.</p>

      <p>Guix is a 100% free software distribution that can be used in a wide variety of ways.</p>

      <p>Unlike other GNU/Linux distributions, all its packages and configuration is defined in scheme (with Guile). To do that it uses software abstractions. That abstraction enables to reuse the same packages or configurations in various contexts (for instance to build container, to build packages for other distributions, etc).</p>

      <p>This re-usability can enables other project to use Guix in various ways (for testing, for project infrastructure, etc).</p>

      <p>This talk will look at how and why Replicant (a 100% free software Android distribution certified by the FSF) uses or depends on Guix, where it didn't use Guix and why, and future directions with the usage of Guix by the Replicant project.</p>

      <p>In the first part of the talk we'll look at what a search engine like Algolia or Elasticsearch does, how tantivy works, what things we need to do in order to make it suitable for user-facing search and how we implement it into our code to build our own application.</p>

      <p>In the second part of the talk I talk about the biggest issue you run into when building a search engine or any other system designed to store data... Fault tolerance and replication, together we'll go through the challenges of implementing this for a search engine using tantivy, keeping the performance competitive, reliable and the tradeoffs that are made to make it work. We'll look at some existing implementations like Raft and take a dive into the world of eventual consistency!</p>

      <p>With any luck, you'll have a better understanding of how we can build services like search engine using libraries like tantivy along with solving technical challenges like consensus and replication for distributed systems in Rust.</p>

      <p>Since its inception in early 2020 our podcast named Linux Inlaws has gathered an average audience of just short of 8,000 listeners per episode and continues to grow in this fashion. What started out as a hobby project (and to a certain degree still is) covers - peppered with a dash of humour - a wide variety of topics ranging from political and social to technology subjects; attracting key industry figures and projects including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Free Software Foundation Europe, Mozilla's CTO, Nextcloud and BSD core devs to name but a few guests on the show so far.</p>

      <p>The talk gives an overview of the history of the podcast since its creation followed by a discussion of the general approach, the philosophy behind the format and its organisation. A section on the technology stack that drives the highly automated workflow behind the scenes will be of interest not only for buddying fellow podcasters but anybody concerned with media production and distribution in general. In addition, the hosts will shed some light on the challenges we have faced over the years and how these were overcome. The talk concludes with a discussion of the road ahead for the Inlaws and their next twenty years (if not more :-) of making a difference in the community and beyond.</p>

      <p>It wasn't easy to reproduce the same container image from its Dockerfile, due to changes in timestamps and "aptgettable" package versions.
      This lack of reproducibility has been a threat to the trustworthiness of container images and binary artifacts built inside containers.</p>

      <p>In this talk, Akihiro Suda will introduce the current work being done to enable reproducible builds in the Dockerfile ecosystem.</p>
    description: |
      <p>This talk will consist of two parts:</p>

      <p>The first part will explain the current status of implementing the <code>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</code> specification [1] in BuildKit [2] for deterministic timestamps of rootfs files and OCI metadata.</p>

      <p>The second part will introduce a new tool called <code>repro-get</code> [3] which can be used to deterministically install a specific snapshot of apt, dnf, apk, and pacman packages.
      The packages are fetched by their SHA256 hash from various file providers including HTTP(S) sites, local filesystems, OCI registries, and even IPFS.
      The repro-get tool is expected to be used for containers in conjunction with the <code>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</code> work, but it can also be useful in non-container environments.</p>

It enables window-based summarization of the property graph stream by grouping vertices and edges on equal characteristics using so-called key functions.

    description: |-
      <p>Today's technology companies often use multiple content management systems, resulting in information (e.g. source code, document files, and wiki pages) fragmented and stored in many places. Consequently, engineers sometimes end up searching multiple locations one by one, repeating the same query at each place, to look for the information they need.</p>

      <p>A solution would be to build and deploy a search server which, given a query, fetches the relevant code and documents from all the content management systems, much like a web search, such as Google, does on the Internet.</p>

      <p>This would be a daunting task, as it would essentially mean setting up and maintaining the whole end-to-end system of search as a service, from web crawlers to search box UI. Fortunately, there is an OSS search server built for this exact purpose. We are here to share the knowledge, experiences, and insights we have gained so far, so that you can build your own enterprise search server, using OSS.</p>

      <p>In this talk, I will first explain what search-related problems we had to solve, as well as briefly touching on what enterprise search is in general.</p>

      <p>Next, I'll go over what Fess is and explain its core features, which will serve as an introductory, informational session for this lesser-known OSS enterprise search server.</p>

      <p>Moving on to the core part of the talk, I will dive deep into how we configured, customized, and deployed Fess for our specific purpose. Our objectives were</p>

      <ol>
      <li>to index contents on issue tracking/project management tools we use (GitLab &amp; Redmine) and in repositories (Git &amp; Subversion)</li>
      <li>to enable users to search the indexed contents from a single search box.</li>
      </ol>


      <p>We achieved both of these objectives but we had to overcome several hurdles. I will share things such as what pitfalls/shortcomings Fess has and how to overcome them.</p>

      <p>I will also talk about what we have made and contributed; our dev team wrote several patches for fixing and customizing Fess. 3 of the patches are bug fixes and 2 of them have been merged into the mainline. 2 other patches are customizations designed to meet our specific requirements. One of them allows the crawler to pass the custom authentication page of our GitLab implemented with SAML and Keycloak. The other patch re-maps the crawled filesystem paths to the webpage URLs; this was crucial to cut the time to index contents in repositories by reading files on the local filesystem instead of following links on the webpages.</p>

      <p>The goal of this segment is to provide the information which will allow future Fess users to deploy it with a dramatically smaller time and effort investment.</p>

      <p>Then, I will share our experiences with our preliminary deployments inside TOSHIBA. We will explain resource requirements and performance, such as how long it takes to crawl and index a given size of resources (basically web pages and files) using how much computing resource. This will help future Fess users make estimates on how much computing resource they need to secure in order to deploy it. Along with that, we will reveal details such as how Fess's ability to index contents inside Microsoft Office documents and PDF files helped engineers.</p>

      <p>Testing large systems with multiple microservices is hard to understand. You need to understand the whole system, all connections, and how the microservices interconnect.</p>

      <p>With tracing you get a map of everything which makes your whole system easier to understand.</p>

      <p>I want to showcase traditional test-driven development vs the new observability-driven development. I'll use open-source tools like Tracetest and OpenTelemetry to showcase how to use trace-based testing and enrich integration tests with trace data.</p>

      <p>What's the problem?
      Testing large systems and multiple microservices is hard to understand. Such a big system can quickly become convoluted. You need to be a specialist in that area to understand the whole system, all connections, and how the microservices interconnect.</p>

      <p>How do we solve it?
      With tracing you get a map of everything which makes your whole system easier to understand.
      I want to showcase traditional test-driven development vs the new observability-driven development with Tracetest and OpenTelemetry. With observability-driven development, you can improve your traces by using trace-based testing to enrich integration tests.
      No more black boxes when running integration tests. You'll know exactly what's happening in each microservice. You'll also be able to add test specs and assertions for every step the transaction takes through your distributed system!</p>

      <p>What's our production use case?
      Test-driven development is your thing. But, you‚Äôre using OpenTelemetry for traces? You have everything you need to move to observability-driven development. It will leverage your OpenTelemetry traces to create integration tests with more details and precision than ever before.</p>

      <p>We call it trace-based testing. It‚Äôs becoming popular to test systems at an integration or end-to-end level by applying assertions against the data contained in an OpenTelemetry trace.¬†</p>

      <p>These tests can check your code, they can verify your trace info is added correctly and can verify processes that show up deep in the trace worked as expected.</p>

      <p>We‚Äôre building an open-source tool called Tracetest (https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest) to make observability-driven development mainstream. It leverages the observability enabled by OpenTelemetry traces to allow you to create trace-based tests. These tests can check your code, they can verify your trace info is added correctly and can verify processes that show up deep in the trace worked as expected.</p>

      <p>Bluetooth mesh networks enable creation of large scale device networks and can be very useful for a variety of IoT use cases. As the state of open source tools around it needed some love, it was an ideal candidate for developing Rust stack to help developers use it in their solutions. In this session you'll learn about Rust tools available to develop embedded firmware, linux gateways and cloud applications for Bluetooth mesh solutions.
      We'll cover asynchronous embedded Rust with "Embassy" and "Drogue device" projects for writing firmwares and how to use them for mesh applications. Next, we'll explore the state of the mesh on Linux with "Bluez" and "Bluer" projects. We'll see how to use Rust and containers to develop mesh gateways. Finally, we'll describe the final piece needed to build end-to-end solutions, "Drogue IoT cloud".
      With this we laid down the architecture and tools needed to build usable mesh applications. The session participants will get a good overview of the whole stack needed to build mesh IoT applications. They learn the benefits of Rust for building this kind of software and find good starting points to get going with their projects.</p>

      <p>Since its advent in the late 1980s, the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) community now has more than thirty years of experience in strategies for advocacy and encouraging adoption of FOSS.  Results have, unfortunately, been mixed.  While corporate adoption by for-profit companies has led to a boon and integration of FOSS into most corporate practices, the true promise of software rights and freedoms ‚Äî the ability of individual hobbyist and consumers to participate on equal footing with the largest software producers in the world ‚Äî mostly eludes our community.</p>

      <p>This talk examines the wins, losses and challenges that FOSS advocacy has faced in the last thirty years.  We'll explore how failures to foresee both web application deployment and the advent of advertising-based app-oriented software deployment led to serious strategic errors in advocacy and focus of attention.  Many of these problems remain difficult to address, and only frank discussion among activists will reveal new approaches to continue a vibrant FOSS community into the next generation.</p>

      <p>For years, the majority of internet applications have used either TCP or UDP as the transport layer protocol of choice. Recently, a new contestant - QUIC, an end-to-end encrypted protocol - has entered the ring. QUIC is being marketed as the successor to TCP and tackles some of its inherent problems. An excellent example is the Head-Of-Line (HOL) blocking issue perceived by, for example, web pages. While QUIC holds many advantages over its predecessor, it still suffers from interoperability challenges and holds a number of open questions. The biggest one is: how do we efficiently test, measure, and debug the performance of applications using QUIC?</p>

      <p>Answering the above question is non-trivial and plays a significant part in my research as a Ph.D. candidate. In this talk, we will ‚Äì from a beginner's perspective ‚Äì discuss why getting started with optimizing applications using QUIC as a protocol might seem daunting. We will discuss some tools available such as qlog, and why they can be more insightful than solely relying on packet traces. Finally, we will demonstrate our in-house developed automation framework called Vegvisir. Initially designed for analyzing the performance of video streaming over QUIC, it is now generalized for end-to-end testing of any networked applications. The goal of Vegvisir is to help alleviate some of the obstacles mentioned earlier, but also to ensure that developers and researchers can perform tests with QUIC consistently and reliably.</p>

      an account on my Mastodon server running in my basement. By the end of the month
      I had scheduled time off my job as a Principal engineer at GitHub and began
      the process of legalizing an entity to protect the service. The rack of hardware
      began to topple over due to the increase in load, and I found myself instantly
      responsible for 30,000 passwords, email addresses, IP addresses, and access
      to several extremely popular technologists personal direct messages. This is
      the overview, research, hypothesis and outcomes that came from the mass exodus
      of Twitter. Learn how I was able to form a cooperative entity to combat the
      impact of ruthless capitalism in Silicon Valley in the name of a sustainable
      free and open source social media service.</p>"
    description: |-
      <p>We start the presentation by communicating data about W3C decentralized protocols, Mastodon adoption, Twitter exodus, and Hachyderm metrics. We spend the first few slides looking at graphs and metrics to demonstrate two outcomes. 1) The world is shifting to decentralized services and 2) These services are forming around W3C standards.</p>

      <p>We move onto a production outage, technical impact, and overview of what it takes to run Hachyderm (my 30k Mastodon instance) behind the scenes. The outage we explore trended #1 on Hacker News and covers the depths of traffic analysis, incident response, ZFS on Linux, systemd, and PostgresQL at scale. We understand how many people are working at Hachyderm, and what the motivation is to give the various contributors financial stake in the entity.</p>

      <p>We spend the next section of the presentation unpacking the consequences of Silicon Valley surveillance capitalism, consequences of hyper-inflated startup exit strategy, and venture capital in general. We learn how the profit motivated model is ultimately responsible for the downfall of centralized and corporate-backed services.</p>

      <p>We explore the legal decision I made to form a cooperative entity, and why I chose this model over a non-profit or regular profit focused corporation. We explore what a "democratic corporation" looks like and draw the analogy to open source software governance. I offer a working model that the broader industry can leverage for their own projects in the same way that GitHub has offered BEIPA as a way to combat invasive ownership problems in corporate tech.</p>

      <p>The audience walks away understanding the nuance between open source technology, and a disruptive shift in how the world is observing profit driven corporations. We look at my experience as a successful open source maintainer and how my passion for free and open source methodology has lead me to adventure down the unprecedented path of cooperative entities for my projects. Learn how I am addressing the problem of open source maintainers not seeing accolades and financial compensation for their work by changing the game of how corporations operate. Learn how my little social media service became the spearhead in a movement that I hope will disrupt the tech industry, and set a precedent for equality and sustainability for the world.</p>

    raw_abstract: "<p>In November of 2022 over 30,000 Twitter refugees decided to
      create an account on my Mastodon server running in my basement. By the end of
      the month I had scheduled time off my job as a Principal engineer at GitHub
      and began the process of legalizing an entity to protect the service. The rack
      of hardware began to topple over due to the increase in load, and I found myself
      instantly responsible for 30,000 passwords, email addresses, IP addresses, and
      access to several extremely popular technologists personal direct messages.
      This is the overview, research, hypothesis and outcomes that came from the mass
      exodus of Twitter. Learn how I was able to form a cooperative entity to combat
      the impact of ruthless capitalism in Silicon Valley in the name of a sustainable
      free and open source social media service.</p>"
    raw_description: |-
      <p>We start the presentation by communicating data about W3C decentralized protocols, Mastodon adoption, Twitter exodus, and Hachyderm metrics. We spend the first few slides looking at graphs and metrics to demonstrate two outcomes. 1) The world is shifting to decentralized services and 2) These services are forming around W3C standards.</p>

      <p>We move onto a production outage, technical impact, and overview of what it takes to run Hachyderm (my 30k Mastodon instance) behind the scenes. The outage we explore trended #1 on Hacker News and covers the depths of traffic analysis, incident response, ZFS on Linux, systemd, and PostgresQL at scale. We understand how many people are working at Hachyderm, and what the motivation is to give the various contributors financial stake in the entity.</p>

      <p>We spend the next section of the presentation unpacking the consequences of Silicon Valley surveillance capitalism, consequences of hyper-inflated startup exit strategy, and venture capital in general. We learn how the profit motivated model is ultimately responsible for the downfall of centralized and corporate-backed services.</p>

      <p>We explore the legal decision I made to form a cooperative entity, and why I chose this model over a non-profit or regular profit focused corporation. We explore what a "democratic corporation" looks like and draw the analogy to open source software governance. I offer a working model that the broader industry can leverage for their own projects in the same way that GitHub has offered BEIPA as a way to combat invasive ownership problems in corporate tech.</p>

      <p>The audience walks away understanding the nuance between open source technology, and a disruptive shift in how the world is observing profit driven corporations. We look at my experience as a successful open source maintainer and how my passion for free and open source methodology has lead me to adventure down the unprecedented path of cooperative entities for my projects. Learn how I am addressing the problem of open source maintainers not seeing accolades and financial compensation for their work by changing the game of how corporations operate. Learn how my little social media service became the spearhead in a movement that I hope will disrupt the tech industry, and set a precedent for equality and sustainability for the world.</p>

      <p>Since last year's FOSDEM, the Fuzion language has seen two major enhancements:
      algebraic effects and type features.  Algebraic effects provide a means to
      manage non-functional side-effects of calls, while type features provide means
      to attach logic to type parameters providing more power to generic types.</p>

      <p>This talk will explain algebraic effects and type features in Fuzion and show
      how they can be used.  Algebraic effects provide means to manage non-functional
      aspects like I/O, global and local state, exceptions and much more.  This can be
      used to automatically detect security issues due to side-effects.  Many examples
      will be given that show how typical code patterns in Java can be realized in a
      purely functional way using effects and type features.</p>
    description: |-
      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>Fuzion is a modern general purpose programming language that unifies concepts
      found in structured, functional and object-oriented programming languages into
      the concept of a Fuzion feature.  It combines a powerful syntax and safety
      features based on the design-by-contract principle with a simple intermediate
      representation that enables powerful optimizing compilers and static analysis
      tools to verify correctness aspects.</p>

      <p>Algebraic effects are a relatively new mechanism currently in use in some
      research programming languages to make side-effects explicit.  The motivation
      for this is to make any side-effects explicit and use this information either
      for security analysis or to permit optimizations, e.g. to automatically detect
      redundant calls or potential for parallelism.  An analysis of side-effects of
      library code could have made it clear early on that code contains the log4shell
      vulnerability by exposing the side effects of network access and possible
      loading of code.</p>

      <h1>Algebraic Effects</h1>

      <p>Algebraic Effects are sets of operations that encapsulate a side-effect in a way
      that is orthogonal to otherwise purely functional code.  Algebraic effects
      represent values that are additional implicit arguments and results of functions
      that depend on an operation provided by an effect.</p>

      <p>Such functions must be called with an instance of the effect available in the
      environment they are called from.  Effects can be installed for a certain region
      of code.  Regions using given effects can be nested and inner regions may
      replace the effects installed in surrounding regions.</p>

      <p>When an operations of an effect is performed, say <code>read</code> on a file-I/O effect,
      that effect typically returns with a result, in this case the byte read.  Is is
      said that the caller resumes operation with the result value.  However, an
      operation may as well abort a calculation, which means that it will not return a
      result but continue execution at the end of the region for which the effect was
      installed.  In the general case, the operation of an effect may resume with 0,
      1, or more results, while the effect is responsible of joining the resulting 0,
      1, or more execution paths.</p>

      <p>In a sense, Java's exception mechanism has a lot in common with effects: The
      <code>try</code>-block defines the region, while <code>throw</code> corresponds to aborting an
      operation and the <code>catch</code> or <code>finally</code> clauses perform the required code to
      produce a result from a resumed or aborted operation.</p>

      <h1>Effects in Fuzion</h1>

      <p>In Fuzion, effects are Fuzion features that inherit from base library feature
      <code>effect</code> and define their operations as inner features.  Effects are identified
      by their type. Imagine we define an effect <code>x</code> that provides an operation <code>y</code>,
      then we would do</p>

      <pre><code>x : effect is
        y(arg some_type) =&gt; ...some operation...
      </code></pre>

      <p>A feature <code>f</code> using effect <code>x</code> to perform operation <code>y</code> given value <code>v</code> would then write</p>

      <pre><code>f =&gt;
        ...
        x.env.y v
        ...
      </code></pre>

      <p>This means that effect <code>x</code> is taken from the current environment to call
      operation <code>y v</code>.</p>

      <p>Before <code>f</code> can be called, we must install an instance of <code>x</code>. This can be done as follows:</p>

      <pre><code>x.use ()-&gt;f
      </code></pre>

      <p>Where <code>x</code> creates this instance and <code>use</code> installs it while executing the
      provided lambda <code>()-&gt;f</code>, which in this case does nothing but call <code>f</code>.</p>

      <p>Fuzion provides a static analysis tool to determine for each feature the set of
      effects a call to that feature may require. There is currently no syntax to
      include in a feature declaration the set of effects that feature requires.
      However, it is planned that for library code, such syntax will be added to
      document the effects directly required.  It is this analysis that permits the
      detection of the safety of code.</p>

      <h1>Type Features</h1>

      <p>In Fuzion, features may have type parameters and value parameters, similar to
      Java's method that may have generic arguments and 'normal' arguments.  In
      Fuzion, however, type parameters are treated much the same way as value
      parameters, but they can additionally be used as types.</p>

      <p>It is possible to call a feature on a type argument. A simple example is the
      following</p>

      <pre><code>f(A type, v A) is
        say "f called with type $A and value $v"

      f u16 123
      f 123       # using type inference for A
      f 3.14
      </code></pre>

      <p>resulting in</p>

      <pre><code>f called with type u16 and value 123
      f called with type i32 and value 123
      f called with type f64 and value 3.14
      </code></pre>

      <p>In Fuzion, every feature defines a type, which is the type of its local
      instance.  Type features are features declared implicitly for every feature.
      Type features duplicate the inheritance tree of their underlying features, such
      that type features can be inherited and redefined.</p>

      <p>The values of type parameters are instances of these type features and the inner
      features that can be called are the features defined for the type feature. We
      can, e.g., redefine <code>asString</code> in a type feature as follows</p>

      <pre><code>point(x, y i32) is

        redef asString      =&gt; "point $x $y"
        redef type.asString =&gt; "!!!my point type!!!"

      f (point 3 4)
      </code></pre>

      <p>resulting in</p>

      <pre><code>f called with type !!!my point type!!! and value point 3 4
      </code></pre>

      <p>This mechanism is more powerful than generics as used in Java since we can
      define additional functionality, e.g., each type could provide an operation to
      compare values of that type.</p>

      <h1>Mapping Java to Fuzion</h1>

      <p>The talk will present code examples of how this will be done:</p>

      <h2>Packages, Classes, Interfaces, instance methods</h2>

      <p>These are all represented by (nested) Fuzion features.</p>

      <h2>static methods</h2>

      <p>Fuzion does not have static features, every feature is declared as an inner
      feature of some outer feature and called on an instance of that outer feature.
      However, type features provide a natural place for what is a static method is
      Java.  But there is more: these can be inherited and redefined!</p>

      <h2>Variables updates</h2>

      <p>In Fuzion, all fields are immutable, i.e., it is not possible to change a
      value. In code like</p>

      <pre><code>x := 123
      say x
      x := 2*x
      say x
      x := x+1
      say x
      </code></pre>

      <p>there are actually three fields <code>x</code> declared, only the later ones masks the
      earlier ones.  It is not possible to write a setter as follows</p>

      <pre><code>x := 123

      setX(v i32) =&gt;
        x := v
      </code></pre>

      <p>since this would just define a new local field <code>x</code> within the feature <code>setX</code>.</p>

      <p>Mutable fields must be declared explicitly:</p>

      <pre><code>x := mut 123
      say x
      x &lt;- 2*x
      say x
      x &lt;- x+1
      say x
      </code></pre>

      <p>works. But the fact that this code performs a mutation is recorded by the
      side-effect 'mutate'.</p>

      <p>In many cases, mutable variables are not needed, e.g., in a loop</p>

      <pre><code>for
        i := 0, i + 1
      while i &lt; 10 do
        say i
      </code></pre>

      <p>new instances of <code>i</code> are created for each loop iteration, so <code>i</code> is never
      modified.</p>

      <h2>I/O operations</h2>

      <p>TBD: Will give an example how I/O is performed via an effect</p>

      <h2>Exception handling</h2>

      <p>A simple example using an untyped try-raise:</p>

      <pre><code>divide (a, b i32) =&gt;
        if b = 0
          try.env.raise (error "division by zero!")
        a / b

      show_div(a, b i32) =&gt;
        r := try i32 (() -&gt; divide a b)
        match r
          v i32 =&gt; say "ok, result is $v"
          e error =&gt; say "not ok: $e)

      show_div 100 12
      show_div 100 0
      show_div 10 100
      </code></pre>

      <h2>static fields</h2>

      <p>Immutable static fields in Java are often used for constants. In Fuzion, these
      can be just type features resulting in a constant.</p>

      <p>Mutable static fields, however, are used for side-effects like caching of
      intermediate results.  Fuzion effects can be used here as well,</p>

      <p>A cache effect does this for us:</p>

      <pre><code>expensive =&gt;
        say "sleeping 3sec..."
        time.nano.sleep (time.durations.seconds 3)
        4711

      my_cache(val i32) is

      expensive_with_cache =&gt; (cache my_cache (() -&gt; my_cache expensive)).val

      say expensive_with_cache
      say expensive_with_cache
      </code></pre>

      <h1>Status of Fuzion</h1>

      <p>Fuzion is still in an early prototype stage, but the language is reaching a more
      stable state. Some of the syntax shown here is still subject to change.  We are
      developing sample code to compare different options and choose a clear syntax.</p>

      <p>A large number of examples is shown on the Fuzion website
      <a href="https://flang.dev">flang.dev</a>, in particular the
      <a href="https://flang.dev/tutorial">tutorial</a>, <a href="https://flang.dev/idioms">idioms</a> and
      <a href="https://flang.dev/design">design</a> pages.</p>

      <p>Fuzion currently has two back-ends, a Java interpreter and static compiler using C
      as intermediate language.  A tool called <em>fzjava</em> creates Fuzion interfaces for
      Java modules such that interaction with arbitrary Java code is possible.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion and Future Work</h1>

      <p>The addition of algebraic effects and powerful type parameters bring Fuzion a
      big step ahead as a general purpose language.  The use of algebraic effects
      brings a simple and powerful mechanism to provide many features known from
      imperative programming languages to functional world while enabling static
      analysis to ensure that unwanted side-effects do not occur.</p>

      <p>With the language specification becoming more stable, it is now time to develop
      a modern standard library and improve the performance of the back-ends. We are
      currently a small team of three developers at Tokiwa Software bringing this
      ahead, but we are happy get feedback or other active contributors!</p>

      <p>Fuzion is a modern general purpose programming language that unifies concepts
      found in structured, functional and object-oriented programming languages into
      the concept of a Fuzion feature.  It combines a powerful syntax and safety
      features based on the design-by-contract principle with a simple intermediate
      representation that enables powerful optimizing compilers and static analysis
      tools to verify correctness aspects.</p>

      <p>Algebraic effects are a relatively new mechanism currently in use in some
      research programming languages to make side-effects explicit.  The motivation
      for this is to make any side-effects explicit and use this information either
      for security analysis or to permit optimizations, e.g. to automatically detect
      redundant calls or potential for parallelism.  An analysis of side-effects of
      library code could have made it clear early on that code contains the log4shell
      vulnerability by exposing the side effects of network access and possible
      loading of code.</p>

      <h1>Algebraic Effects</h1>

      <p>Algebraic Effects are sets of operations that encapsulate a side-effect in a way
      that is orthogonal to otherwise purely functional code.  Algebraic effects
      represent values that are additional implicit arguments and results of functions
      that depend on an operation provided by an effect.</p>

      <p>Such functions must be called with an instance of the effect available in the
      environment they are called from.  Effects can be installed for a certain region
      of code.  Regions using given effects can be nested and inner regions may
      replace the effects installed in surrounding regions.</p>

      <p>When an operations of an effect is performed, say <code>read</code> on a file-I/O effect,
      that effect typically returns with a result, in this case the byte read.  Is is
      said that the caller resumes operation with the result value.  However, an
      operation may as well abort a calculation, which means that it will not return a
      result but continue execution at the end of the region for which the effect was
      installed.  In the general case, the operation of an effect may resume with 0,
      1, or more results, while the effect is responsible of joining the resulting 0,
      1, or more execution paths.</p>

      <p>In a sense, Java's exception mechanism has a lot in common with effects: The
      <code>try</code>-block defines the region, while <code>throw</code> corresponds to aborting an
      operation and the <code>catch</code> or <code>finally</code> clauses perform the required code to
      produce a result from a resumed or aborted operation.</p>

      <h1>Effects in Fuzion</h1>

      <p>In Fuzion, effects are Fuzion features that inherit from base library feature
      <code>effect</code> and define their operations as inner features.  Effects are identified
      by their type. Imagine we define an effect <code>x</code> that provides an operation <code>y</code>,
      then we would do</p>

      <pre><code>x : effect is
        y(arg some_type) =&gt; ...some operation...
      </code></pre>

      <p>A feature <code>f</code> using effect <code>x</code> to perform operation <code>y</code> given value <code>v</code> would then write</p>

      <pre><code>f =&gt;
        ...
        x.env.y v
        ...
      </code></pre>

      <p>This means that effect <code>x</code> is taken from the current environment to call
      operation <code>y v</code>.</p>

      <p>Before <code>f</code> can be called, we must install an instance of <code>x</code>. This can be done as follows:</p>

      <pre><code>x.use ()-&gt;f
      </code></pre>

      <p>Where <code>x</code> creates this instance and <code>use</code> installs it while executing the
      provided lambda <code>()-&gt;f</code>, which in this case does nothing but call <code>f</code>.</p>

      <p>Fuzion provides a static analysis tool to determine for each feature the set of
      effects a call to that feature may require. There is currently no syntax to
      include in a feature declaration the set of effects that feature requires.
      However, it is planned that for library code, such syntax will be added to
      document the effects directly required.  It is this analysis that permits the
      detection of the safety of code.</p>

      <h1>Type Features</h1>

      <p>In Fuzion, features may have type parameters and value parameters, similar to
      Java's method that may have generic arguments and 'normal' arguments.  In
      Fuzion, however, type parameters are treated much the same way as value
      parameters, but they can additionally be used as types.</p>

      <p>It is possible to call a feature on a type argument. A simple example is the
      following</p>

      <pre><code>f(A type, v A) is
        say "f called with type $A and value $v"

      f u16 123
      f 123       # using type inference for A
      f 3.14
      </code></pre>

      <p>resulting in</p>

      <pre><code>f called with type u16 and value 123
      f called with type i32 and value 123
      f called with type f64 and value 3.14
      </code></pre>

      <p>In Fuzion, every feature defines a type, which is the type of its local
      instance.  Type features are features declared implicitly for every feature.
      Type features duplicate the inheritance tree of their underlying features, such
      that type features can be inherited and redefined.</p>

      <p>The values of type parameters are instances of these type features and the inner
      features that can be called are the features defined for the type feature. We
      can, e.g., redefine <code>asString</code> in a type feature as follows</p>

      <pre><code>point(x, y i32) is

        redef asString      =&gt; "point $x $y"
        redef type.asString =&gt; "!!!my point type!!!"

      f (point 3 4)
      </code></pre>

      <p>resulting in</p>

      <pre><code>f called with type !!!my point type!!! and value point 3 4
      </code></pre>

      <p>This mechanism is more powerful than generics as used in Java since we can
      define additional functionality, e.g., each type could provide an operation to
      compare values of that type.</p>

      <h1>Mapping Java to Fuzion</h1>

      <p>The talk will present code examples of how this will be done:</p>

      <h2>Packages, Classes, Interfaces, instance methods</h2>

      <p>These are all represented by (nested) Fuzion features.</p>

      <h2>static methods</h2>

      <p>Fuzion does not have static features, every feature is declared as an inner
      feature of some outer feature and called on an instance of that outer feature.
      However, type features provide a natural place for what is a static method is
      Java.  But there is more: these can be inherited and redefined!</p>

      <h2>Variables updates</h2>

      <p>In Fuzion, all fields are immutable, i.e., it is not possible to change a
      value. In code like</p>

      <pre><code>x := 123
      say x
      x := 2*x
      say x
      x := x+1
      say x
      </code></pre>

      <p>there are actually three fields <code>x</code> declared, only the later ones masks the
      earlier ones.  It is not possible to write a setter as follows</p>

      <pre><code>x := 123

      setX(v i32) =&gt;
        x := v
      </code></pre>

      <p>since this would just define a new local field <code>x</code> within the feature <code>setX</code>.</p>

      <p>Mutable fields must be declared explicitly:</p>

      <pre><code>x := mut 123
      say x
      x &lt;- 2*x
      say x
      x &lt;- x+1
      say x
      </code></pre>

      <p>works. But the fact that this code performs a mutation is recorded by the
      side-effect 'mutate'.</p>

      <p>In many cases, mutable variables are not needed, e.g., in a loop</p>

      <pre><code>for
        i := 0, i + 1
      while i &lt; 10 do
        say i
      </code></pre>

      <p>new instances of <code>i</code> are created for each loop iteration, so <code>i</code> is never
      modified.</p>

      <h2>I/O operations</h2>

      <p>TBD: Will give an example how I/O is performed via an effect</p>

      <h2>Exception handling</h2>

      <p>A simple example using an untyped try-raise:</p>

      <pre><code>divide (a, b i32) =&gt;
        if b = 0
          try.env.raise (error "division by zero!")
        a / b

      show_div(a, b i32) =&gt;
        r := try i32 (() -&gt; divide a b)
        match r
          v i32 =&gt; say "ok, result is $v"
          e error =&gt; say "not ok: $e)

      show_div 100 12
      show_div 100 0
      show_div 10 100
      </code></pre>

      <h2>static fields</h2>

      <p>Immutable static fields in Java are often used for constants. In Fuzion, these
      can be just type features resulting in a constant.</p>

      <p>Mutable static fields, however, are used for side-effects like caching of
      intermediate results.  Fuzion effects can be used here as well,</p>

      <p>A cache effect does this for us:</p>

      <pre><code>expensive =&gt;
        say "sleeping 3sec..."
        time.nano.sleep (time.durations.seconds 3)
        4711

      my_cache(val i32) is

      expensive_with_cache =&gt; (cache my_cache (() -&gt; my_cache expensive)).val

      say expensive_with_cache
      say expensive_with_cache
      </code></pre>

      <h1>Status of Fuzion</h1>

      <p>Fuzion is still in an early prototype stage, but the language is reaching a more
      stable state. Some of the syntax shown here is still subject to change.  We are
      developing sample code to compare different options and choose a clear syntax.</p>

      <p>A large number of examples is shown on the Fuzion website
      <a href="https://flang.dev">flang.dev</a>, in particular the
      <a href="https://flang.dev/tutorial">tutorial</a>, <a href="https://flang.dev/idioms">idioms</a> and
      <a href="https://flang.dev/design">design</a> pages.</p>

      <p>Fuzion currently has two back-ends, a Java interpreter and static compiler using C
      as intermediate language.  A tool called <em>fzjava</em> creates Fuzion interfaces for
      Java modules such that interaction with arbitrary Java code is possible.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion and Future Work</h1>

      <p>The addition of algebraic effects and powerful type parameters bring Fuzion a
      big step ahead as a general purpose language.  The use of algebraic effects
      brings a simple and powerful mechanism to provide many features known from
      imperative programming languages to functional world while enabling static
      analysis to ensure that unwanted side-effects do not occur.</p>

      <p>With the language specification becoming more stable, it is now time to develop
      a modern standard library and improve the performance of the back-ends. We are
      currently a small team of three developers at Tokiwa Software bringing this
      ahead, but we are happy get feedback or other active contributors!</p>

      <p>Regardless of how Kubernetes attempts to secure secrets, frequently rotating those secrets is certainly a best practice. It also poses a huge challenge, especially when done manually in a highly distributed environment: ensuring secrets are rotated in time, everywhere without affecting availability without making mistakes is no job for humans.</p>

      <p>Have you tried to join a crowded room on Matrix on a young server where you are the first to do so ? It's... slow.
      It will manage eventually but you can make your favorite beverage in the meantime.</p>

      <p>Hopefully the Matrix and Synapse people has been at work this year to substantially improve that, and this talk will present you the details about it.
      Our journey will begin with presenting the needed specs changes, and then go through the various implementation foot-guns that we had to dodge.</p>

      tool based on LLVM: PARCOACH'

      <p>PARCOACH is a static and dynamic analysis tool for High Performance Computing applications (using MPI and OpenMP for instance), based on LLVM.
      Its main purpose is to check that the APIs usage are correct (for instance that all processus or threads call a barrier to avoid a deadlock).
      It's not always possible to detect all errors statically, therefore the static analysis can be complemented by a dynamic instrumentation of the code to perform some correctness checks during the code execution.</p>

      <p>This (out-of-tree) tool has been initially written based on LLVM 3.7, and is now based on LLVM 15.
      As a research project, it has seen a lot of contributions: from PhD students, from interns, and from researchers; with actually a low number of LLVM-specific engineers working on it until recently.
      The objective of the talk would be to focus on how the project has been using LLVM over the years (and how it's been maintained):
        - how the lack of maintainance had lead to a relatively high technical dept.
        - how LLVM tools and structure had been used: from a manual compilation of the code to "properly" using LLVM's CMake integration, from analysis code tangled in the transformation code to properly using the "new" analysis and passes manager.
        - how the CI/CD evolved to improve the user experience (eg: docker-based jobs, automated images and packages generation, docker-compose entry point).
        - the weaknesses remaining in the project (as far as LLVM is concerned), where they come from, and the plan to fix them.
        - and obviously take a look at some mistakes that have been done (trying to maintain compatibility with several LLVM versions at once just to name one).</p>

      <p>While the content of the talk would not be "new" from a scientific point of view, we believe it would provide some interesting take-aways for people looking into developing or maintaining out-of-tree LLVM-based software.</p>

      <p>The emergence of heterogeneous hardware resources has posed a significant obstacle for the Java programming language to keep up with the ‚ÄúWrite Once Run Anywhere‚Äù paradigm. The reality is that several parts of the Java Virtual Machine must be modified to make Java portable for execution on modern heterogeneous hardware, such as GPUs and FPGAs. To tackle that challenge, TornadoVM is implemented in the University of Manchester as an open-source software technology that enables OpenJDK and other JDK distributions to offload parts of Java applications onto heterogeneous hardware for parallel execution.</p>

      <p>This talk will present the latest features of TornadoVM, and it will showcase examples of how the TornadoVM API can be utilized to abstract heterogeneous hardware and increase the performance of Java applications. The goal is to explain the basic terms of TornadoVM including all new API extensions, in order for developers to take advantage of heterogeneous hardware with minimal effort. Finally, this presentation will discuss how TornadoVM is used in research and industry for the acceleration of Java applications.</p>

      <p>OpenTripPlanner is an open source journey planning framework with over 10 years of history. It is constantly evolving, with the version 2.0, including an entirely revamped transit routing algorithm, Multi-Criteria Range-RAPTOR with Destination Pruning, released in the end of 2020. The new algorithm makes it possible to support large national and international deployments. Currently, it powers the national journey planners in multiple countries, including Norway and Finland. At Entur it is used as a basis for systems ranging from ticket sales to physical departure boards at railway stations.</p>

      <p>In this presentation, we will take a quick look into the history of OpenTripPlanner, where does it come from, and how has it evolved over the years. We will take a closer look at the recently released OpenTripPlanner version 2.3 and its new features, as well as a look on the roadmap of which functionality will be coming in the next releases.</p>

      <p>OpenTripPlanner is an open source journey planning framework with over 10 years of history. It is constantly evolving, with the version 2.0, including an entirely revamped transit routing algorithm, Multi-Criteria Range-RAPTOR with Destination Pruning, released in the end of 2020. The new algorithm makes it possible to support large national and international deployments. Currently, it powers the national journey planners in multiple countries, including Norway and Finland. At Entur it is used as a basis for systems ranging from ticket sales to physical departure boards at railway stations.</p>

      <p>In this presentation, we will take a quick look into the history of OpenTripPlanner, where does it come from, and how has it evolved over the years. We will take a closer look at the recently released OpenTripPlanner version 2.3 and its new features, as well as a look on the roadmap of which functionality will be coming in the next releases.</p>

      as it is very easy to process and visualize data using traditional charts. However,
      they lack utilities to properly explore networks interactively. The ipysigma
      library therefore proposes a Jupyter widget enabling its users to perform visual
      network analysis from the comfort of a notebook. ipysigma makes it simple to
      tweak a network's visual variables to display it exactly as you intend. This
      way, you can perform a work at the crossroad between Python processing of graph
      data and visual exploration like you would do for example with Gephi. It supports
      networkx and igraph seamlessly and can be easily used by numpy and pandas users
      all the same. Different usecases of ipysigma will be showcased during the talk
      through a dataset about FOSDEM history. We will also demonstrate how ipysigma
      is able to render synchronized &amp; interactive "small multiples" of a same
      network so that one can easily compare different features. ipysigma is developed
      at the m√©dialab of SciencesPo and uses graphology and sigma.js (JavaScript libraries

      <p>Setting your first steps in the world of programming can be a daunting task. The tools used are unforgiving, and learning materials are too often based on rote learning and writing code from scratch.  Many learners feel excluded and like they do not belong, this is especially true for learners that are from groups underrepresented in programming education. In recent years the Predict-Run-Investigate-Modify-Make (PRIMM) approach has been proposed to help students by focusing on learning how to read code before moving on to learning how to write it.</p>

      <p>In this lightning talk we will discuss how open source micromaterials can be created as small side or hobby projects, taking into consideration these concepts. We will do so by discussing some open source micro-materials we made, but we will also take a look on how to ensure that your contributions provide educational value.</p>

      <p>iothnamed is a DNS server/forwarder/cache for the Internet of Threads supporting hash based IPv6 addresses and OTIP, i.e. one time IP.</p>

      <p>Hash based IPv6 addresses:
      The host part of an IPv6 address can be computed as the result of a hash function computer on the fully qualified domain name.
      This eases the life of system administrators dealing with IPv6 networks.</p>

      <p>One Time IP:
      OTIP means that the current IP address of a server changes periodically to prevent networking attacks. This method has mainly been designed for IPv6 networks.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Hash Based IPv6 address:
      The configuration of an IPv6 network is a rather daunting and error-prone procedure for system administrators. Each node must be provided with its own (128 bit long) IPv6 address and with a domain name manageable by human beings.
      Autoconfiguration methods can give addresses to interfaces but do not provide any means of configuring the DNS. So autoconfiguration is suitable for clients. If a host has to act as a server, it must have a fully qualified domain name and the DNS service has to map its name to its IP address.
      In the Internet of Thread scenario, the number of network nodes can be orders of magnitude higher than before, as each process or thread can be a node. This idea of hash based IPv6 addresses is a viable solution to the problem to manage the DNS resolution in IoTh environments.</p>

      <p>One Time IP:
      Hosting servers use a finite number of IP addresses to connect on the net. Attackers can collect those by wiretapping the network and create a catalog of valid addresses and services in order to attack the servers. OTIP can prevent these attacks, or make them harder to succeed as the addresses collected by network sniffers expire in a short time. OTIP aims to provide one further layer of protection for private services.</p>

      <p>This talk will present our usage of SPDK, Storage Performance Development Kit,
      with the Xen hypervisor and discuss memory sharing mechanisms in hypervisors
      from a security and performance perspective.</p>

      <p>SPDK is a userspace NVMe driver allowing access to these types of storage
      devices with minimal overhead from the operating system. It allows you to
      maximize the performance usage of new storage technologies, as well as having faster
      development times of applications serving IO because of the easier development
      cycle of running in userspace. In our case, we use it as a storage backend
      for virtual machines where an SPDK application establishes a connection with
      virtual machines through shared memory.</p>

      <p>This sharing of memory, in a virtualized environment, gives access to the
      outside world to a virtual machine. In the case of Xen, the sharing mechanism,
      called Grant Table, uses the hypervisor as a trusted intermediary to allow
      sharing memory with another virtual machine. The backend doing device
      multiplexing only get access to areas explicitely permitted by the frontend.
      This permits the guest to not completely trust the storage provider software
      with complete access to private memory, but the extra security of this model
      doesn't come for free. We would like to discuss improvements that could be
      added that would still keep the security aims of the Grant Table mechanism
      while providing a high performance interface.</p>

      <p>OpenStack and Ceph have a long integration story that changed over the time to make the two technologies coexist in the same context as basic building blocks of Cloud infrastructures.
      ceph-ansible has been one of the most popular orchestrators for Ceph, but cephadm and the Ceph orchestrator have been a game changing in the way how operators interact with Ceph.
      To streamline the deployment process, OpenStack services need to be configured to interact with Ceph but there is also a  need to bootstrap, configure and tune the Ceph cluster to meet the OpenStack workload.
      An example is Manila, where the new ceph mgr interface enabled new drivers and simplified the existing use cases.

      <p>We will give a brief introduction to electric vehicle charging technology, including an overview of the standards and protocols involved.
      This will be followed by a deep dive into how you can build your own AC charging station with open hardware, utilizing the EVerest open source software stack.
      Concluding the talk, we will present an outlook on how you could assemble a DC charging station with readily available components.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The primary goal of EVerest is to develop and maintain an open source software stack for EV charging infrastructure. You can think of it as an operating system for EV chargers with implementations of communication protocols, software modules for representations of hardware devices and tools for simulating the charging process.
      In this talk you will learn how you can adapt and use EVerest with existing charging station hardware, as well as building your own AC and DC charging stations. We will show you how you can get started by using open hardware designs and schematics in combination with open source software to build a charging station that will reliably charge your electric vehicle.</p>

      <p>The open source package OpenSTEF provides a complete software stack which forecasts the load on the electricity grid for the next hours to days.

      <p>WebAssembly (wasm) is a binary format to run applications in lightweight virtual machines. Many compilers support wasm as a target next to arm and x86_64. The WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) is a standardized API for wasm apps to talk to the outside world. They‚Äôre the ‚ÄúSystem Calls‚Äù of the WebAssembly world.</p>

      <p>Combining these two gives you a very lightweight but very secure way to isolate applications. Each wasm app runs in their own sandbox and the runtime decides what external resources it can access. Moreover, wasm apps start up lightning fast!</p>

      <p>This proof of concepts builds on the initial work of Markus Th√∂mmes and Francesco Guardiani, who introduced the idea of running Kubernetes controllers in WebAssembly. We ported this work to wasmtime and added the ability to unload controllers when they're not being used. Our results show controllers running in wasm use up to 68% less memory compared to containerd. Moreover, by unloading the controllers when they're not needed, the controllers use an additional 50% less memory.</p>

      <p>The BPF Hashmap and other hash-based BPF maps including Stackmap and Bloom Filters use an old hash function, jhash. Therefore, this should not be difficult to improve the maps performance by using a better hash function. However, this is true only in the ideal world, i.e., when we load the Linux kernel with mitigations=off. This is not as straightforward in the real world.</p>

      <p>In this talk I will describe obstacles which appear in the real world and how to approach them. Also, I will talk about how to benchmark BPF maps and kernel code in general and look into how fast BPF maps are actually performing.</p>

      <p>At a time where make was developed, a simple and computationally cheap solution
      to the problem of how to handle the relation between artifacts and files was
      needed. Each artifact is associated with a file in the filesystem and the
      timestamp of the file was used to determine which actions (recipes) need to be
      executed. Traditionally, to be backwards compatible with make, subsequent build
      systems also implemented this concept. However, there is no technical reason to
      do it like this. Instead, it even has a couple of advantages if this concept is
      abandoned and no association of artifacts with the filesystem is done. Nowadays,
      where content-addressable storage is a widely applied concept and actions are
      anyway executed in an isolated environment may it be in a separate directory or
      in a sandbox, this problem can be tackled by a complete separation between
      physical and logical paths, which is also called staging. Input and output paths
      of an individual action are abstracted away. Thus, each target has its own view
      of the world and can place generated artifacts at any logical path they like.
      Consuming targets may place these generated artifacts at a different logical
      location. This allows to define build targets independently of their actual
      location and in particular allows to refer to targets from other repositories.
      This simplifies the handling of different repositories. All what matters is how
      the target is defined and not where. This concept is implemented in an
      open-source build system, which is publicly available under the following link:

      <p>Chromium has used V4L2 for cameras for many years and it works reasonably¬†

      <p>We present BastionLab, a Rust open-source privacy framework for confidential data science collaboration.
      We aim to help data owners open access to their datasets to outside data scientists. The current approaches, such as opening Jupyter notebooks, provide no elaborate control over what is shared. Datasets can easily be extracted from them, which means they offer little privacy guarantees and make data collaboration difficult.</p>

      <p>BastionLab provides an interactive interface for data scientists to explore remote datasets, yet answers the privacy concerns of data owners, as only results compliant with the privacy policy defined by the data owners can be communicated.</p>

      <p>Data exposure is limited as data scientists never have direct access to the data, they can only use a limited set of operators which preclude arbitrary code execution to exfiltrate data, and a strict access control policy is put in place. Differential Privacy and Trusted Execution Environments are supported as well to ensure maximum privacy.
      We will provide an example to show how a COVID dataset could be shared to a remote data scientist to perform data exploration, cleaning and visualization, while making sure only anonymized results are communicated.
      The server side of BastionLab is developed in Rust for its memory safety, performance and community. It allows the use of cutting-edge libraries like polars, an open source DataFrame library in Rust several times faster than pandas, the go-to solution in Python.</p>

      <p>Wayland is an open source display server protocol aiming to replace X11 on Linux devices with a modern and secure windowing system. As of today most of the popular desktop Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora,  support Wayland out of the box. Wayland is also widely used on embedded devices and it is supported by hardware running Automotive Grade Linux (AGL), COVESA (previously GENIVI), WebOS, Tizen, postmarketOS, Jolla, etc.</p>

      <p>There are many compositors compatible with Wayland. Weston is a simple reference compositor. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary network protocol with graphical user interface for connecting to other computers developed by Microsoft. It works on Weston with the screen-share.so plugin.</p>

      <p>This lightning talk will provide the exact steps how to build from scratch core-image-weston, setup RDP and remotely accesss the embedded device using wlfreerdp (for Wayland) or xfreerdp (for X11) from a personal computer with GNU/Linux distribution in the same network. The examples will be based on the long-term support release kirkstone of the Yocto Project.</p>

      <p>The talk is appropriate for anyone interested in remote access to embedded Linux devices. Previous experience is not required.</p>

      <p>CNI plugins ‚Äì we love them for getting our Kubernetes networking untangled. Sometimes ‚Äì we want to manage them in a more cloud-native fashion, using Kubernetes itself. Doug is here to guide you on a tour of a proof-of-concept CNI plugin, one that automagically probes your nodes for devices, and allows you (or your Kubernetes controllers! Or your AI/ML!?) to add semantics to your Kubernetes network attachment ‚Äì and help you answer the question: ‚ÄúWhich network am I really attaching my pods to?‚Äù, letting you express how to map your pod networking to devices, and to networks themselves.</p>

      <p>Today, when you use the reference CNI plugins, such as macvlan and ipvlan CNI, you‚Äôre given a kind of magical power: Using native Linux capabilities for networking your workloads in Kubernetes. This is low level and powerful. We all know that networking isn‚Äôt simple when you‚Äôre in the real world, there‚Äôs lots of existing infrastructure and grim realities of data centers. Flexibility is clutch here, and low level solutions help us to build towards these realities. However, Kubernetes is meant for scale, and for expression of intent at a higher level. This approach is an example of how we can meet these requirements for low-level definitions of our network attachments to meet Kubernetes goal of large scale ‚Äì especially at scale and in non-uniform server environments.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>This talk will encompass a demo of a brand new CNI plugin and auxiliary components which allow you to map devices to networks, and associate your pods attachments to devices at a higher level, with more automagic, so you don‚Äôt have to baby the workload specifications at the lowest possible level, and take advantage of how Kubernetes can help you orchestrate these attachments.</p>

      <p>You‚Äôll learn a lot about CNI! You‚Äôll get instructions to take home on how to get this CNI plugin running in your own lab, and it‚Äôll give you a test bed for learning how to make your own CNI plugins too. Even if you‚Äôre not a CNI plugin developer, it‚Äôll help you understand better what your CNI plugins are doing, and help you diagnose issues in your own Kubernetes deployment. We‚Äôll also talk about device plugins for Kubernetes and you‚Äôll get to learn about how device availability impacts scheduling workloads.</p>

      <p>While this talk encourages you to get into the nitty gritty of CNI ‚Äì Doug really wants to invite you to become a participant in bigger picture efforts for the Kubernetes networking community, too. There is a nascent Kubernetes-native MultiNetworking effort, the Kubernetes Network Plumbing Working Group, and upcoming work for CNI 2.0. This talk, and PoC project represents some problems that we need to solve as a community ‚Äì If we don‚Äôt represent the community and what we all want ‚Äì we lose out to the commercial efforts which will steamroll the community and leave our (already overtaxed!) sysadmins in the dirt. We all need common ground to work together upon, and it‚Äôs up to the community to set those standards and let the commercial efforts follow.</p>

      <p>CNI is the ‚ÄúContainer Networking Interface‚Äù, and it‚Äôs an API for setting up networking for containers, and also used by Kubernetes. We love it for its simplicity, and for the fact that it‚Äôs a common ground for networking in Kubernetes, and we already know, container networking isn‚Äôt always easy. What you might not know is that CNI itself is ‚Äúcontainer orchestration engine agnostic.‚Äù For a 1.0, this limitation makes sense, and we need to respect the origins of this thinking, and it allows some overarching constructs that are useful for both orchestration engines, and container runtimes (like crio and containerd), but we need a step forward in terms of Kubernetes given how ubiquitous it‚Äôs become, and continues to become in the networking space.</p>

      <p>Doug believes that we need an evolution, or potentially, a revolution for CNI 2.0. One that gives us a layer to speak to CNI using Kubernetes. If we don‚Äôt have this pathway, it encourages developers to ignore CNI and build their own Rube Goldberg machine, and sysadmins have already had to chase the rolling ball down the chute to light the match to drop the mousetrap enough as it is. We need standards, not contraptions!</p>

      <p>There has been a significant shift from on-premise data centers to the cloud in the last fifteen years. This process was due to the perceived cost difference between the legacy on-premise data centers and the newer and shinier cloud. Due to a renewed interest in privacy and data sovereignty, many organizations
      are returning to the on-premise. For the success of such initiatives, it is fundamental to learn from the past and understand how a modern on-premise data center would be structured.
      I started working in 2004 when almost everything was on-premise, and I had a front-row seat to the migrations that occurred in this period thanks to my roles as a Systems and Solutions Architect.
      In this talk, we will recap the last twenty years of migrations to learn some key lessons, and then we will analyze what a modern on-premise data center would look like, which technologies might help and which could be risky bets.</p>

      <p>Multipath TCP (MPTCP) support in the Linux kernel has started in v5.6. At that time, only a single path could be used. The MPTCP development community has steadily expanded from the initial baseline feature set to now support a broad range of MPTCP features on the wire and through the socket and generic Netlink APIs.</p>

      <p>An overview of MPTCP will be presented with an explanation of what is possible today in the Linux kernel and what should come next. The development of MPTCP in the Linux kernel is particular and has not been directly available on a vanilla kernel. Indeed, after 10 years of experimentations on the side -- in an Open-Source "out-of-tree" kernel -- the implementation has been rewritten (almost) from scratch to get an "upstreamable" result that is still being improved today. On the other hand, the out-of-tree kernel was and is still used today in production on large deployments with million of users. Maintaining this out of tree kernel with more than 21k modified lines for each different LTS version has a cost and also introduce some risks and complex situations that are interesting to share.</p>

      <p>For Java developers, the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is key to improved performance.

      OKD is an Open Source Community Distribution of Kubernetes optimized for continuous application development and multi-tenant deployments. OKD is a sibling community distribution to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
      OKD Virtualization is built on top of the KubeVirt project and its sibling operators.
      The Hyperconverged Cluster Operator project ensures an opinionated and robust deployment automating common Day-1 (installation, configuration, etc.) and Day-2 (re-configuration, failover, etc.) operations.
      The Hyperconverged Cluster Operator is available in the Openshift Community Operators catalog and so also on your OKD cluster.
      In this session you will learn about fresh OKD Virtualization features like:
      - Deploying a single node development/testing environment on CodeReady Containers (with nested virtualization) on your laptop
      - Using KubeVirt Tekton tasks to automate VM common tasks (creating/copying VMs, generating ssh keys, executing commands into a VM or manipulating disks with libguestfs tools) in a CI/CD fashion
      - Automatic importing and updating of pre-defined or custom boot sources</p>

      <p>After this session newcomers will know what OKD Virtualization is while experienced users will get a sneak peek of new and upcoming features.</p>

    abstract: "<p>A number of open‚Äësource energy system models are now active in the
      global south and this presentation provides an update.</p>"
    description: |-
      <p>Energy system models are simulations of future energy systems that can be used to test scenarios. More specifically, such models can explore a range of net‚Äëzero options in an integrated fashion, determine which scenarios are feasible, and then report on system development trajectories, detailed and aggregate costs, and related attributes for further consideration. Many of the underlying modeling frameworks are now fully‚Äëfledged open‚Äësource projects.  In addition, there are several nascent initiatives to develop coherent databanks and also the overarching data standards they require, with both endeavors suitably open licensed.</p>

      <p>These various efforts are now starting to spill into the global south generally and sub‚ÄëSaharan Africa in particular. A number of potential benefits then arise from this kind of open analysis.  The first is the zero monetary cost of course.  The next is organic knowledge transfer both northward and southward within the various project communities. A third is doubtless that a greater range of scenarios will be placed on the table ‚Äî indeed I sense that the multilateral agencies working in Africa have settled on a selected set of solutions and that suggestions that fall outside the prevailing orthodoxy are unwarranted and unwanted. A fourth potential advantage is local engagement, and further, the prospects of improved local autonomy ‚Äî and while there are no examples of model‚Äëmediated public processes in the global south as yet, that concept is being trialed in the global north.</p>

      <p>The use of open analysis in the global south will offer distinctive challenges nonetheless.  The most obvious difficulty is data availability and a number of proxy solutions have been developed.  The next is how best to channel these efforts into public policy formation and then on to live projects.  Also critical will be the necessity of finding new ways of interacting between official agencies and these clearly informal modeling communities.</p>

    raw_abstract: "<p>A number of open‚Äësource energy system models are now active
      in the global south and this presentation provides an update.</p>"
    raw_description: |-
      <p>Energy system models are simulations of future energy systems that can be used to test scenarios. More specifically, such models can explore a range of net‚Äëzero options in an integrated fashion, determine which scenarios are feasible, and then report on system development trajectories, detailed and aggregate costs, and related attributes for further consideration. Many of the underlying modeling frameworks are now fully‚Äëfledged open‚Äësource projects.  In addition, there are several nascent initiatives to develop coherent databanks and also the overarching data standards they require, with both endeavors suitably open licensed.</p>

      <p>These various efforts are now starting to spill into the global south generally and sub‚ÄëSaharan Africa in particular. A number of potential benefits then arise from this kind of open analysis.  The first is the zero monetary cost of course.  The next is organic knowledge transfer both northward and southward within the various project communities. A third is doubtless that a greater range of scenarios will be placed on the table ‚Äî indeed I sense that the multilateral agencies working in Africa have settled on a selected set of solutions and that suggestions that fall outside the prevailing orthodoxy are unwarranted and unwanted. A fourth potential advantage is local engagement, and further, the prospects of improved local autonomy ‚Äî and while there are no examples of model‚Äëmediated public processes in the global south as yet, that concept is being trialed in the global north.</p>

      <p>The use of open analysis in the global south will offer distinctive challenges nonetheless.  The most obvious difficulty is data availability and a number of proxy solutions have been developed.  The next is how best to channel these efforts into public policy formation and then on to live projects.  Also critical will be the necessity of finding new ways of interacting between official agencies and these clearly informal modeling communities.</p>

      <p>Two of the leading open‚Äësource framework projects, OSeMOSYS and PyPSA, have begun significant efforts to broaden into the global south.  These two initiative will be reviewed (I am not directly involved in either).</p>

      <p>Clearly early days still but sufficient progress has been made to warrant an update at FOSDEM'23.</p>

      <p>In this short talk, we'll present a way to see the discourse around digital sovereignty through a climate lens - understanding how the concepts that support having a vibrant diverse set of cloud providers can result in a healthy ecosystem climate wise , and also in terms of values alignment too.</p>

      <p>We'll introduce a useful model, known as the Green Web Triangle, for talking about the trade-offs we currently make when choosing digital services that can help technologists have productive conversations with budget holders and policy makers.</p>

      <p>Finally we'll explore how competing on transparency with open source is a valid strategy where existing incumbent cloud providers cannot do the same - organisations with legally binding carbon reductions are now required by investors and policy to report on efficiency and sustainability in ways that are currently impossible with most incumbent providers, but doing so will be a legal necessity, as new laws around sustainability reporting come into effect in 2024. We'll end with Q and A to explore these new developments and how to make the most of the changing policy landscape to move towards a more open, diverse ecosystem of companies building the cloud platforms we need for a sustainable, pluralistic diverse internet.</p>

    abstract: <p>The GNU Guix package manager/distribution provides its own containers
      as part of a more general tool, 'guix shell' for quick one-off or repeatable
      environments. The container option is isolated from the host system, with options
      to expose directories, network interfaces, and so on. This is an excellent tool
      for isolating software in a completely controlled and reproducible environment
      in a minimal way. Recently, we added an option to emulate the Filesystem Hierarchy
      Standard (FHS) within the container, so that this environment looks like a more
      "typical" distribution with a global '/lib', '/bin', etc., unlike a Guix system.
      This is helpful for developing or running software which expects or assumes
      an FHS file layout. For example, many language environments want to manage their
      own tools and download binaries, or some software isn't yet packagable for Guix,
      like a fully source and bootstrapable JavaScript application. These would otherwise
      be very difficult to use in Guix and now we can do so in an (isolated) environment.
      This talk will introduce 'guix shell' and the container and emulate-FHS options
      with examples of real-world use.</p>

In the early years after standardisation, High-dynamic-range (HDR) videos tends to be under served in open source encoders for a variety of reasons including the relatively small amount of true HDR content being broadcast and the challenges in optimisation with that material. Fast-forward to 2022, there has been a rise of HDR content which is publicly available.
      In this presentation, we review the state of AV1 4K HDR compression with open-source implementations, present challenges and strategies to adopt for a scientific testing environment for HDR evaluation, and brief introduction to a content-adaptive transcoding strategy for HDR videos.</p>

      <p>Open-source tools based on LLVM that target rich software platforms such as Linux are in widespread use. A large proportion of the investment in upstream LLVM development is targeted at this use case. There is much less use of open-source C/C++ toolchains for embedded software development, with GCC toolchains being dominant. This can be explained by a number of factors:
      * Assembling an embedded toolchain is complicated, due to cross-compilation and missing components such as the C-library.
      * Differences in the toolchain interface and missing functionality compared to GCC.
      * Code-size and performance gaps on embedded targets.</p>

      <p>There are efforts in the LLVM community to improve the suitability for embedded software development. This presentation will cover some of the gaps and what we are trying to do to fill them. Specifically:
      * Hosted versus embedded toolchains.
      * Why do we want to use LLVM for an embedded toolchain?
      * What components make up an embedded toolchain, and which of these can be supplied by the LLVM project.
      * The LLVM bare metal driver.
      * A comparison of a LLVM based toolchain against an equivalent GNU toolchain.
      * Work that is being done in the community to improve embedded development.
      * How to get involved!</p>

      <p>The presentation does not require any in depth knowledge of LLVM or compilers. An awareness of the components of a toolchain such as compiler, linker and libraries will be helpful.

      <p>Using checksums for verifying disk image download is very common, but how do you verify uploading a disk image to a virtual disk or verify that a backup is correct? The standard tools such as sha256sum cannot help since the disk image and the virtual disk may use different image formats. Even if the image formats match, standard tools are too slow to handle huge virtual disks which typically contain a small amount of data and a large amount of unallocated space.</p>

      <p>In this talk we will present SUSE's storage team's latest passion project, s3gw (https://s3gw.io), an easy-to-use S3-compatible service for kubernetes environments. Although focused to work on top of Longhorn (https://longhorn.io), s3gw can leverage any local filesystem or Persistent Volume provided to it. The project is divided in two main components: the s3gw service, a Ceph RADOS Gateway with a custom, filesystem based backend, leveraging RGW's SAL implementation; and the s3gw UI, not only for management tasks but also providing a bucket and object explorer.
      During our time together we will discuss s3gw's backend implementation, and present the UI, with a small demonstration of how to deploy the project on a small kubernetes cluster. With this talk we would love to also gather feedback from the attendees, so we can feed back into project development.</p>

      <p>Music is like a structured language so why not try to program parts of it.
      With Melr≈çse I found a good mix between writing music and interacting using audio feedback.
      The presentation will be come with lot of tunes, sounds and demos.</p>

      <p>In the Kubernetes resource allocation model, abstract concepts like resource request and limits, container QoS (quality of service), etc are being used. These concepts are eventually being converted under the hood to cgroup configurations, which have their own resource management model and concepts like CPU shares, CFS quotas, etc.</p>

      <p>In the context of Kubevirt, an add-on to Kubernetes to allow running cloud-native VMs alongside containers, this information is crucial. In fact, our own ‚ÄúCgroup Manager‚Äù was implemented to mutate and configure the container cgroups that are being defined to us by Kubernetes. One especially interesting challenge was to support a true CPU Pinning for VMs running on top of Kubernetes.</p>

      <p>This presentation will take you through our journey to support true dedicated CPUs for VMs. I hope that after taking part in this presentation, the audience will better understand Kubernetes and Cgroup resource allocation models and how they can be further utilized in the future. In addition, I wish that the info presented here will improve the collaboration between different technologies in the ecosystem like Cgroups, KVM, libvirt, Kubevirt and Kubernetes by raising awareness to how they all interact together in different and interesting use-cases.</p>

      <p>Gephi is a popular open source network visualization software. In this talk we propose to share how we build the future of Gephi on two levels: the code, and the rest.</p>

      <p>For two years, we have been making efforts to sustain Gephi over the long term. The threats to the project are sometimes about the code, sometimes not: what if a library we use, and is no longer maintained, becomes incompatible with the latest MacOS? What if the few people who know the codebase get out of the project, and we cannot transfer that knowledge to new devs? What if we fail to recruit new developers?</p>

      <p>There is a lot of good will around Gephi, and yet making the project healthy is not easy because the path to sustainability is not obvious. This is the discussion we want to have with developers, both to share what works, and to get some feedback to improve. We are not there yet, and we struggle to recruit Java developers.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>This talk will be given by two co-founders of the project, Mathieu Bastian, the historic architect of the Gephi codebase, and Mathieu Jacomy, the designer of Gephi and a researcher in network visualization.</p>

      <p>In short, the topics we want to touch upon are:
      * What is the Gephi road map and why is it how it is
      * The path to funding the project
      * Our "Gephi code sustainability retreats", where they shined, where they failed
      * The relation we build two communities: the users, and the devs.
      * Documenting the codebase and engaging developers
      * How the Gephi project acknowledges the web as a platform (Gephi Lite)</p>

In order to get analytical insights out of these structures, scalable implementations of graph algorithms are necessary. Rust is the ideal language for implementing such algorithms, due to its well-known aspects, such as "fearless concurrency" and memory safety as well as its great out-of-the-box performance and its expressive type system.</p>

In addition to these building blocks, we started developing a Python wrapper called graph-mate for a NetworkX-like experience and an Apache Arrow endpoint for integrating the project in distributed applications.

      <p>Python's asyncio module for concurrency evolved quite a bit in the past few years. Thanks to input from projects like Trio and Anyio, we now have constructs in Python 3.11 that allow us to adopt "structured concurrency" in Python. This is an approach to concurrency that leads to applications that are less prone to bugs, but also much easier to understand.</p>

      <p>During this presentation, we'll have a look at the principles behind structured concurrency and how to use them. We'll have a look at task groups, exception groups and finally will be diving deep into the importance of understanding cancellation.</p>

      <p>This will be an exciting tour in the world of concurrency where hopefully everyone learns something new.</p>
    description: |
      <p>The presentation is for anyone who's familiar with at least basic Python constructs and has also at least some understanding of concurrency (either multithreading or asyncio). Previous asyncio experience is helpful, but not needed. Experienced asyncio users will probably also find it interesting.</p>

      <p>The presentation comes from two point of views:</p>

      <ol>
      <li><p>The importance of structured concurrency. The idea that functions should not spawn tasks/threads that can outlive the function call for multiple reasons (hard to reason about, issues with exception handling, resource leaking, etc...). This is an idea that is not unique to asyncio, but also applies to multithreading/multiprocessing.</p></li>
      <li><p>The importance of cancellation as a way of terminating anything. Cancellation is the one feature that threads don't offer, but asyncio does. (A thread can't be killed), and this is what allows us to use many concurrency constructs (timeout, termination, racing of different tasks, ...) that are not available with multithreading.</p></li>

      <p>Capabilities are tokens of authority that are unforgeable and delegable.
      The Morello architecture extends the Armv8.2-A profile with features that implement the CHERI capabilities and protection model. It implements 129-bit CHERI capabilities with compressed bounds, which provide a compromise between memory consumption and bounds precision.
      The Morello architecture also inherits the rules for architectural features and extensions from Armv8.2-A.
      There is ongoing work on Linux kernel support with fine-grained memory protection and scalable compartmentalization features.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we discuss how Morello hardware features introduce new opportunities for designing kernel abstractions to achieve intra-kernel privilege separation and hardening the kernel's security-sensitive subsystems and drivers. We further explain our work on guarding FUSE filesystem and a few changes to the user-kernel privilege separation model. We hope this talk opens essential discussions with the Linux kernel community to improve hardware-assisted hardening mechanisms within the kernel.</p>

      <p>The License Review Working Group of the Open Source Initiative was created to improve the license review process. In the past, the process has been criticized as unpredictable, difficult to navigate, and applying undisclosed requirements. The Working Group developed a set of recommendations for revising the process for reviewing and approving or rejecting licenses submitted to the OSI. The recommendations include separate review standards for new and legacy licenses, a revised group of license categories, and some specific requirements for license submissions. The recommendations are available [link to be provided] and the OSI is in the feedback stage of its process, seeking input on the recommendations. The session will review the proposed changes and also take feedback from the participants on what it got right, what it got wrong, and what it might have missed.</p>

      <p>Note that the following is out of scope for the Working Group:</p>

      <p>A review of the Open Source Definition itself

      <p>The major BSD Operating Systems, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, tend to evolve independently from each other. However, they still share large parts of their respective vision and idioms - in other words, they have way more similarities than differences to each other. An important common requirement is to support a wide range of computer devices and equipment. Unfortunately, device drivers from a BSD system are usually not directly suitable for the others. The differences vary in different amounts depending on each subsystem, bus, kernel API, etc.
      This presentation will illustrate the situation with a few examples, and work as a call for volunteers from every BSD project. The goal is to explore areas where more code can be shared among the different BSDs, with a focus on device drivers. Generally, good ideas deserve a chance to be visible across the different systems!</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The aim of this presentation is to attempt to create a common effort, in any shape or form, in order to foster cooperation between the major BSD systems in terms of driver development in particular.
      The ideal outcome of this presentation could be the creation of a committee and/or of a mailing-list - formal or informal - which could convene regularly and share the state of the development for each BSD, and identify areas where designs could converge towards easier code sharing of device drivers for instance.
      I am myself involved with the NetBSD project (khorben@), member of the Board of the NetBSD Foundation, and would happily coordinate on that side.</p>

      <p>I held a presentation at LibreOffice Conference 2022 with the Title "LibreOffice graphics subsystems - History &amp; Visions - From Win3.1 GDI to scene graphs". There I explained in detail the past, common and possible future graphics subsystems for LibreOffice. One aspect of this is the transition/escape path to get to new shores and allow to let old stuff completely behind, so reaching new shores.
      When I prepared that talk I started to implement a complete and working example how to do system-specific PrimitiveRenderers. I promised to continue and finish that in my private time, so I managed to get a working version. In this talk/presentation I want to talk about the process, what experiences I made to create the example, about upstream stuff that had to be done in master to prepare the ground for others and about the state of affairs.
      I will also make a short presentation/comparison with a version of the office that uses that new technic with the current one to present made achievements.</p>

      <p>We all know that observability is a must-have for operating systems in production. But we often neglect our own backyard - our software release process. That was our mistake, which led us to wasting time and energy in handling failures in the CI/CD pipeline, and made our Developer-on-Duty (DoD) shifts tedious.</p>

      <p>On this talk I‚Äôd like to share how we built effective observability into our CI/CD pipeline using intelligent data collection, dashboarding and alerting, to boost our response to failures and improve our quality of life on the way.</p>

      <p>This talk will give practical guidance on how to improve observability into your CI/CD pipeline. Whether you use Jenkins like we do, or other CI/CD tools, you‚Äôll learn how to augment them and reach higher productivity.</p>

      <p>Starting your own startup can be both very similar and very different to starting your own business, or even starting an open source project. It provides you the opportunity to be your own boss and control your destiny, while working on something that you are passionate about that can make a positive impact on the world. A startup, however, is different in that it's expected to grow rapidly and reach a high level of revenue, often raising money from investors to expedite this growth. There are many ways to start successful businesses, and a rapid growth startup is only one of them.</p>

      <p>Open source startups are great for the open source community, and we will all benefit from having more of them started. They bring in more contributors, and enable more people to work on open source software full time, making for more quality open source software. Successful open source startups also tend to contribute to upstream projects, both financially and with code contributions, making the whole ecosystem better. While there is a lot of information online about starting your own startup, there is much less information about starting open source ones.</p>

      <p>In this talk Tom will talk about why you should or should not start an open source startup, and what you need to consider when building an open source startup, covering topics such as fundraising, business model, product, and more. Tom will draw examples from his experience building two successful open source businesses, one of which has raised over $10m in venture capital, and the experiences of fellow founders of other successful open source startups.</p>

    abstract: "<p>Compiler-rt is a set of runtime routines present in LLVM infrastructure
      to support and provide an implementation of various builtin functions for multiple
      architectures. It consists of ‚Äì builtin libraries, sanitizer runtimes, profile
      runtimes, and block runtimes. This talk focuses on one of the compiler rt components-
      sanitizers. Compiler-rt sanitizers are used to perform runtime checks on compiled
      code. These checks can include detecting and preventing common programming errors,
      such as buffer overflows and memory leaks, as well as more sophisticated checks,
      such as undefined behavior sanitization, which can help detect and prevent subtle
      bugs that can be difficult to find using other methods. This talk will provide
      an introduction to compiler rt sanitizers in LLVM, and how to use them on various
      architectures starting with an example of memory sanitizer for x86 architecture.
      Second part of the talk will cover ‚Äì how compiler-rt sanitizers can be used
      for 32-bit and 64-bit ARM architecture and integrate in development and testing
      using Software development kit (SDK) built with Yocto. Also useful for the development
      of applications for memory-constrained embedded devices using clang and LLVM.</p>"

      <p>For years, we‚Äôve been told that Java suffers from cold starts in AWS Lambda and Serverless in general. Believe it not. Java is extremely fast to start, the simplest Java program starts in milliseconds. It‚Äôs the Java app servers, frameworks and libraries that usually slow things down. But there are now many ways to start Java apps fast.</p>

      <p>In this session, I want to show you the truth about Serverless Java and cold starts, what‚Äôs slow, what‚Äôs fast and why it matters. We‚Äôll explore Piranha Cloud, one of the most modern and fastest Jakarta EE frameworks, and how it can start Java apps very fast.</p>

      <p>Then I‚Äôll explain which Java Virtual Machine optimizations may help if you need to start apps even faster.</p>

      <p>You‚Äôll see live for yourselves how Java AWS Lambda functions built with Jakarta EE can start fast and decrease the cold starts to the absolute minimum which you can barely notice.</p>

      <p>The mkosi-initrd project builds initrds directly from system packages.
      This means that there is no separate dependency and packaging system.
      Normal system packages and services are used in the initrd.
      This means that we don't need to build a duplicate set of scripts.
      Systemd is used to the maximum extent ‚Äî it sets up the environment and manages jobs in the initrd.
      Requirements and dependencies for startup tasks must be expressed as unit properties.
      Systemd's functionality is used to manage secrets, measure state,
      and load system extensions to extend the initrd.

      <p>Flang is the new Fortran frontend of LLVM. While the frontend is not yet ready for general use, significant progress has been made. In this talk I summarise the progress that has been achieved and the major development thrusts.</p>

      <p>Flang supports compilation of most of Fortran 95. Significant progress is being made on Fortran 2003 features. Flang can compile Spec and other important benchmarks. Some work has been done to improve performance. Further work is under way, this includes Alias Analysis, improved codegen for Array Expressions and Assumed shape arrays. A new dialect called HLFIR (High Level FIR) is also under construction. This dialect will capture more higher level Fortran info in the IR. Flang is mostly OpenMP 1.1 compliant. Significant progress has been made with the Driver as well. The presentation will cover these points.</p>

      <p>Platform APIs are usually tough to test. They hide complexity from users and abstract a wide range of backend services, ranging from heavy infrastructure over to simple SaaS APIs. Sometimes these processes can take up to hours to finish.</p>

      <p>In this talk we will share our experience testing the platform API and introduce you to the tools we have written along the way.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The actual platform API is provided through crossplane. Writing crossplane compositions is not always easy and testing them with all possible combinations and outcomes is even harder. It requires a lot of effort to make sure all components are deployed correctly and work as expected ‚Äì especially if you have a lot of them. Since everything is written in YAML and crossplane is a relatively new technology, there is no standard set of tools to test everything yet.</p>

      <p>To test our compositions automatically, we have set up a CI pipeline that consists of two test stages: A static code analysis using our self-written linter for Crossplane that runs various checks, like ensuring that all patches are pointing to an existing resource property. The second stage consists of end-to-end tests built with Kuttl and compares the status of real provisioned infrastructure with the expected outcome.</p>

      <p>This is the 4th edition of the "Status of AMD platforms in coreboot". As usual
      the talk will cover the most recent news around the AMD support in open-source
      firmware ecosystem and updates of the topics covered in previous years. The
      current situation of coreboot project will be disclosed along with new
      deprecations and shifting more platforms out of the main tree.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>The history of AMD cooperation in coreboot projects reaches 2007 where the
      first contribution appeared for the Geode LX processors. AMD's open-source
      support continued for many years until now (with some break). Recent coreboot
      release enforced new requirements on the features supported by the silicon code
      base. More aging AMD platforms kept losing interest and many of them (including
      fully open ones) starting to cause unjustifiable overhead, because of
      accumulated technical debt. And yet again we experience similar situation as
      with the famous 4.11 branch becoming de facto stable branch for some more AMD
      platforms (open-source AGESA family14, family15tn, family16kb). Despite the
      efforts to keep the platforms in the tree by implementing the necessary
      changes, they landed onto the stable 4.18 branch.</p>

      <p>Nowadays AMD is releasing the newest AGESA/FSP with the cooperation of hired
      coreboot developers. The support covers modern mobile Ryzen chips on Chromebook
      devices. We (3mdeb) trying to support the AMD platforms by reimplementing the
      ASUS KGPE-D16 (FSF RYF platform) support in coreboot. However, the situation is
      growing direr as the maintainership of PC Engines platforms by 3mdeb has
      ended. We would like to present Dasharo plan for long term stable and
      sustainable support for older platforms. If you are interested in open-source
      firmware for most open x86 platforms on the market feel free to tune in and
      discuss the ideas with us.</p>

This talk will discuss how GNU¬†Guix lets users deploy software optimized for the target machines while preserving provenance tracking and reproducibility.</p>

      <p>Why is HPC seen as antithetical to reproducibility in the first place? Maybe your cluster admins told you: if you want peak performance, you have to use the software stack that they themselves or the hardware vendors installed and tailored specifically to this cluster, and to recompile your code locally.  Your software deployment becomes tied to this machine and hardly reproducible elsewhere.</p>

      <p>However, by giving up on reproducibility, we would give up on verifiability, a foundation of the scientific process.  How can we conciliate performance and reproducibility?  Engineering work that has gone into performance portability has already proved fruitful, but some areas remain unaddressed when it comes to CPU tuning.  This talk looks into package multi-versioning, a technique developed for GNU¬†Guix, a tool for reproducible software deployment.  We will show that it allows us to implement CPU tuning without compromising on reproducibility and provenance tracking.</p>

      <p>However, by giving up on reproducibility, we would give up on verifiability, a foundation of the scientific process.  How can we conciliate performance and reproducibility?  Engineering work that has gone into performance portability has already proved fruitful, but some areas remain unaddressed when it comes to CPU tuning.  This talk looks into package multi-versioning, a technique developed for GNU¬†Guix, a tool for reproducible software deployment.  We will show that it allows us to implement CPU tuning without compromising on reproducibility and provenance tracking.</p>

      <p>There's a lot of consumer open-source products out there, beyond the realm of developer tools. There are now open-source competitors for almost any proprietary productivity, project and knowledge management, and other digital tools.
      But to fully take advantage of open-source so far required at least basic coding knowledge -- without it, one is not able to fork or self-host the software, and is confined to using the cloud version only.
      Open-source PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) solutions such as Caprover and Gardens offer a way out. They allow to easily host server-side or web-apps through the UI or CLI, and automate most of the complexity usually associated with setting up and maintaining self-hosted software. This presentation tells a story of how these products came about and how they work.</p>

      <p>Services where the code is published as free software provides a huge mitigation to SaaSS, but to keep your software freedom, you need to identify it and avoid using it.</p>

      <p>This talk will first explain some finer points of SaaSS going beyond what is written on gnu.org.

I will introduce an edge case as an example that the line is not always black and white. The audience will gain confidence in evaluating services they encounter for whether any parts are SaaSS.</p>

      <p>There has been relatively little attention paid to SaaSS, but it is on the rise especially with AI services. I will suggest some practical cases and approaches for raising the issue of SaaSS. Is there a simpler way to put it? Maybe "That kind of service should only run on your own computer as free software."</p>

      <p>Publishing free sources for non-SaaSS services is also important and warrants some discussion. If most services aren't SaaSS, why does the FSF recommend the AGPL for all service software? Users of services and society at large deserve the sharing of service software for reasons other than SaaSS which I will discuss.</p>

      <p>NLnet Labs and Red Hat are closely following two legislative proposals from the European Commission applicable to almost all hardware and software on the European market;</p>

      <ul>
      <li>The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), intends to cover products including digital elements, like software, with cybersecurity conformity requirements and obligations.</li>
      <li>The new Product Liability Directive (PLD) is looking to extend liability for defective products to the world of software.</li>

      <p>The audience will learn about the CRA and PLD from different angles: from their respective authors at the European Commission, from a small, public benefit organisation producing and supporting upstream open source software, and from organisations promoting, using and distributing open source software.</p>

      <p>The session will be divided in two parts:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>A series of lightning talks from representatives of the European Commission and NLnet Labs to introduce the subject.</li>
      <li>A panel, moderated by Red Hat, with participation from Digital Europe, the EC Open Source Program Office, Red Hat and NLnet Labs to share views and opinions about the future of open source software within the current and future legal framework.</li>

      <p>Postgres provides a plethora of performance metrics useful for monitoring tools available through SQL. However monitoring a traditional relational database using modern observability tools presents some unique challenges.</p>

      <p>Postgres's metrics can be extremely detailed and provide rich information about the relationships between the different database objects. However this requires custom SQL queries and the getting the right level of detail depends heavily on understanding style of architecture of the database schema. This kind of customization makes it difficult to deploy and maintain any dashboards, or alerts.</p>

      <p>Even on a mundane level deploying an agent to interface through SQL introduces operational difficulty requiring additional custom work to coordinate the agent and database deploy and introducing many failure modes which can result in inaccurate metrics, no metrics, or even cause database outages.</p>

      <p>I'm currently working on improving Postgres's support for modern observability tools and I have plans and challenges to talk about. Ideally I want to make  things work smoothly out of the box without having each site have to write custom queries and design custom dashboards to get the right level of data for their database and adapt it to their deployment environment.</p>

      <p>Once you have identified the particular system introducing a user facing performance degradation, as its developer you need to understand which part (ideally down to the function and line of code) is slowing it down.

      <p>One of the most common complaints about open source software is bad UX.

Open source projects also tend to not invest their (admittedly often limited) resources on UX and UX designers.</p>

      <p>OpenProject is an open-project management and collaboration tool that's been around for over ten years. The software went through its many versions and iterations without a dedicated design team and did so without this necessarily being a problem. But in August 2021 OpenProject GmbH hired not one but two UX designers to improve usability and user experience. I'm one of them.</p>

      <p>Java is a great programming language, however 'traditional' Java isn't so great to work with when it comes to modern, Cloud Native development.  Quarkus is a (fairly) new Java stack that addresses issues such as the typical slow startup time and rather large memory usage that hinder the adoption of Java in container and/or Serverless workloads.  Quarkus is not just useful for optimizing resource usage though.  There is also a big focus on improving the developer experience.  In this session we'll demonstrate how Quarkus is very easy to work with and allows developers to work with containers and external dependencies such as databases, Kafka clusters, Kubernetes etc without being experts in any of these technologies.<br/>

      <p>Standards and specifications straddle the space between software and user-manual‚Äìstyle documentation.</p>

      <p>This session presents a recent case study of the search for an optimal license for a FOSS specification project. It covers establishing intrinsic goals for the specification itself, documenting interoperability concerns triggered by adjacent standards, and the difficulties posed by adopting or adapting licenses used in other free standards.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Specifications may be descriptive for human readers ‚Äî like documentation ‚Äî but may incorporate samples and pseudocode, or snippets that can be quoted within software source files ‚Äî like a derived software program. For FOSS specifications, striking the ideal balance between permissiveness and fragmentation among implementers poses additional challenges. Though no one-size-fits-all solution exists, this session will compare specification-license strategies and explain how the case-study project resolved its own decision.</p>

      <p>The project in question is a specification for OpenType font shaping, but the licensing issues confronted are rather universal. It is a functional specification that attempts to serve as a reference for a variety of software implementations (both FOSS and otherwise) because predictable behavior across vendors is paramount, so there is no one, obvious license to pick for full compatibility. It interacts with prior standards published by other parties, such as Unicode and the multiple owners of OpenType, each of which carries its own license. And it seeks to attract support and buy-in from these outside parties, who may have competing interests.</p>

      <p>In addition to the account of the project's search for potential licenses, the session will also look at the paucity of written resources or best-practices discussions dissecting the issues of specification licenses. It will also enumerate and compare the licenses used by other standards-publishers that impact FOSS developers, including the W3C, IEEE, IETF, and Internet Society, and will attempt to categorize the trade-offs made by each of these publishers. It will also discuss how specification licenses differ from other non-software licenses, such as licenses for datasets and general "commons" works.</p>

      <p>Attendees will come away with a renewed perspective on the questions facing authors of standards and specifications, as well as with up-to-date knowledge of how various specification publishers have described the rights granted and withheld in their licenses and the terms and conditions placed on their consumers. Discussion is encouraged, to distill some pertinent principles primed for practical processes.</p>

      <p>[Although the session relates to fonts and text encoding, no prior experience with font internals is required. Attendees should expect, however, to be shown the occasional UTF-8 or UTF-16 codepoint in the slides and be ready to avert their gaze if they feel unprepared.]</p>

      <p>In the ARM world, Secure Boot is typically a BootROM feature, which allows for verification of the loaded binaries (firmware, bootloader, Linux kernel) before executing it. The main idea is to prevent untrusted code from running on our platform. The general approach is similar across vendors, but this area has no standardization.</p>

      <p>This is the 2nd edition of such an overview. During the presentation, we will check the status of the Secure Boot feature on ARM SoCs shown a year ago, and then we will expand this by describing examples on Rockchip and Mediatek based boards. The knowledge contained in this talk should help developers integrate Secure Boot into their platforms, contributing to increased security in the world of embedded devices.</p>

      <p>We are developing an open source federatable management system for FabLabs, Makerspaces and Hackerspaces. FabAccess aims to manage access to machines in order to avoid accidents.
      FabAccess has three main functionalities:
      - Machine management
      - Authorization system
      - User management</p>
    description: |-
      <h2>Machine management</h2>

      <p>We want to combine Neil Gershenfeld's idea of users learning to operate machines independently with the requirements of open workshops that users do not injure themselves in the process. Thus, users need instruction for dangerous machines, and this principle is then reflected in the authorization system.</p>

      <p>The principle of FabAcces is to switch machines on and off via the power connection or via internal firmware. This way, machines are normally de-energized and therefore harmless. Only when users are at the machine who are competent and instructed for safe operation, the machine gets connected to the power supply by FabAccess.</p>

      <p>The management of machines that require cleaning after use is supported, either. This ensures the usability of machines for the next user and reduces wear and tear.</p>

      <p>We also support the reservation of machines, but we do not want to take over scheduling for the users. Therefore, as a compromise we implement that users can reserve machine only for half an hour (as a modifiable parameter). So they don't have to worry about someone else using the machine while they commute to the FabLab.</p>

      <h2>Authorization system</h2>

      <p>The authorization system makes it possible to allow access to machines only for certain users. Thus, it can be used to map instructions for dangerous machines, but more complex mappings are possible due to the high configurability of the RBAC system (role-based access system).</p>

      <p>It is also possible to map simple machines that do not require instruction but need to be used in a somehow structured way (workplaces, tools, lockers, ..).</p>

      <h2>User management</h2>

      <p>The user administration should make it possible not to lose track of the users in the space. FabAccess is intended to be used as a SmartCard system, so each user receives an NXP Mifare DESFire (FabCard) card to authenticate himself at the machine.</p>

      <p>In order to reduce the administrative effort, users can register on their own and can then be activated after the operator has checked their data. The user contract is mapped in the process and may be integrated into other systems.</p>

      <p>Application developers working and testing with a specific kernel version should be able to easily control their application compatibility behavior with previous (and future) kernel versions as well. We developed a Landlock library (for security sandboxing purpose) that protects users as much as possible while making the work of application developers easier and safer.</p>

      <p>This talk gives feedback about the development of a security library that needs to deal with backward and forward compatibility, because of security features tied to specific kernel versions, handling different use cases in a safe and secure way. We explain patterns that we used to make it possible to fine tune the requested (optional) features while providing a safe default behavior. For simple use cases, the idea is to provide a best-effort security approach for potentially unsupported kernel features: use available features and ignore others. However, in more complex use cases, we may want to make some features depend on others. We may also want to handle errors differently based on unsupported features.</p>

      <p>Application developers working and testing with a specific kernel version should be able to easily control their application compatibility behavior with previous (and future) kernel versions as well. We developed a Landlock library (for security sandboxing purpose) that protects users as much as possible while making the work of application developers easier and safer.</p>

      <p>This talk gives feedback about the development of a security library that needs to deal with backward and forward compatibility, because of security features tied to specific kernel versions, handling different use cases in a safe and secure way. We explain patterns that we used to make it possible to fine tune the requested (optional) features while providing a safe default behavior. For simple use cases, the idea is to provide a best-effort security approach for potentially unsupported kernel features: use available features and ignore others. However, in more complex use cases, we may want to make some features depend on others. We may also want to handle errors differently based on unsupported features.</p>

      <p>What can engineers do for digital humanities? What are the issues that our open source community can solve in this context?</p>

      <p>This talk will report two years experience in helping researchers in humanities (philosopher, literature scholar, archivists...) in approaching their problems.
      At the end the audience will get an overview of tools and methods that were well received by this community and why.</p>

      <p>This talk is presented by the center of Digital Humanities of Uppsala University (CDHU).</p>

      <p>For a project of a reasonable size, there's usually more than one source for the website that needs to be published. For several years, Antora is known as a site generator which pulls AsciiDoc content from multiple Git repositories at once. It publishes a static website where users find a navigation, online search and linked pages, with the option to group everything by component versions.</p>

      <p>In 2022, Antora made the leap to open its publishing process to plugins: They allow pulling information dynamically during the build process and forward the content not only to a static HTML site, but other targets like PDF as well. This talk outlines what is possible today with these extensions, and how it can be extended for custom needs.</p>

      <p>Several open-source software projects like Fedora, Eclipse Che, Camel, Debezium and Couchbase use Antora. For developers it is normal to develop software in collaboration using their IDE and a version control system like Git.

      <p>Several examples will be from the Eclipse Che project which leveraged the Antora extensions in 2022. Additional examples show how to enrich the content with metadata and to use the information when building the site, and how to get feedback from the users of the site.</p>

      <h1>What is Heads</h1>

      <p>Heads is a secure runtime environment and a build system; a build recipe cookbook, which boards configurations instructs which modules to be incorporated in the mix needed for specific platform board configuration.</p>

      <p>Heads takes advantage of the linux kernel and common linux tools to create its runtime environment, including kexec, busybox, whiptail, cryptsetup, flashrom, LVM, the GPG toolstack, and other important and already existing tools to empower its runtime environement.</p>

      <p>The typical output of a build are a packed initramfs and kernel, included inside a coreboot ROM image as its payload. Depending on the architecture/chipsets of a platform, it also integrates neutered/deactivated Intel ME/CSME binary blob (platform dependent), generated Gigabit Ethernet (GBE) configuration blob and an unlocked descriptor (IFD). The produced firmware images requires the platform to be flashed once externally to overwrite the origin flash chip(s) content, more specifically to overwrite locked IFD and ME/MCSE regions and to maximize the BIOS region to the extent of liberated Intel ME firmware region. Heads firmware upgrades can then happen internally for the lifetime of the platform.</p>

      <h1>Why Heads</h1>

      <p>Heads take advantage of coreboot measured boot in Static Root of Trust (SRTM) mode as a measurement base, which currently measures itself as early as possible, normally from bootblock(or romstage) into TPM a singleregister (PCR2). Heads payload is then executed after measured and extends TPM with its own measurements in distinct PCRs in the goal of sealing secrets in TPM's distinct NV regions. Kernel modules are measured prior to being loaded, LUKS drive(s) headers are measured if a TPM disk encryption key is configured, while going to the Recovery shell invalidates the TPM measurements by the same TPM extend mechanism.</p>

      <p>From a user standpoint, those sealed secrets enables oneself to validate the integrity of the firmware either through TOTP code shown on screen on its smartphone or through HOTP (which challenges validity against supported enabled HOTP USB Security dongles). Another TPM sealed secret enables the user to release an additional LUKS disk encryption key only if the firmware is intact, that kernel modules loaded and Headers are consistent to sealed state and only if provided passphrase matches. Heads also validates user detached signed /boot digests against its fused in rom public key, which guarantees both integrity and authenticity of the trusted boot configuration prior of kexec‚Äôing into it.</p>

    abstract: <p>KDLP is a novel program run by Red Hat engineers to address the industry-wide
      shortage of qualified entry-level candidates for low-level software engineering
      jobs in general, and the Linux kernel in particular. We created, developed,
      and teach an "Introduction to Linux Kernel" development course to University
      of Massachusetts Lowell students and anyone who is interested. We recruit qualified
      students from our class to internship programs within Red Hat, and we promote
      the best interns to hiring managers with the aim of bringing them into the industry
      as full time software engineers. We have pulled together this program from scratch
      over the past few years, iterating our program and curriculum design in order
      to stand the program on its feet. As an established program, we plan to continue
      to scale our program and strengthen our partnerships, including a recent one
      with the Linux Foundation, in order to bring Linux kernel and low-level software
      engineering education to a larger audience and global talent pool.</p>

      <p>A spectre is haunting the Linux kernel... the spectre of time!</p>

      <p>Throughout the industry, we have observed a shortage of qualified entry-level software engineers focused on the low-level niche, and especially within the sub-niche of the Linux kernel. As young, novice software engineers, we noticed this problem, and we quickly became aware that we were far from the only ones to do so. Engineers and managers of all levels within our industry niche have observed -- both privately and publicly -- that we must bring new talent into these spaces, and we must do so urgently. We have seen firsthand among the many talented and experienced engineers firsthand and we have benefited greatly from their guidance and mentorship, but we know that this opportunity will not last forever. Time spares no one, not even the engineers from the days of Digital Equipment Corporation.</p>

      <p>We have come to understand the invaluable and non-quantifiable nature of the tribal knowledge that exists distributed among the great engineers of our industry, and we believe that we must act quickly to enable them to pass on the torch, to strengthen the next link of the great chain of our relatively young but quickly maturing industry.</p>

      <p>With this understanding, we have created the Kernel Development Learning Pipeline, a program to bridge the gaps between academia and industry, between the novice and the legend, between the past and the future.</p>

      University of Massachusetts Lowell students and anyone who is interested. We
      recruit qualified students from our class to internship programs within Red
      Hat, and we promote the best interns to hiring managers with the aim of bringing
      them into the industry as full time software engineers. We have pulled together
      this program from scratch over the past few years, iterating our program and
      curriculum design in order to stand the program on its feet. As an established
      program, we plan to continue to scale our program and strengthen our partnerships,
      including a recent one with the Linux Foundation, in order to bring Linux kernel
      and low-level software engineering education to a larger audience and global
      talent pool.</p>

      <p>A spectre is haunting the Linux kernel... the spectre of time!</p>

      <p>Throughout the industry, we have observed a shortage of qualified entry-level software engineers focused on the low-level niche, and especially within the sub-niche of the Linux kernel. As young, novice software engineers, we noticed this problem, and we quickly became aware that we were far from the only ones to do so. Engineers and managers of all levels within our industry niche have observed -- both privately and publicly -- that we must bring new talent into these spaces, and we must do so urgently. We have seen firsthand among the many talented and experienced engineers firsthand and we have benefited greatly from their guidance and mentorship, but we know that this opportunity will not last forever. Time spares no one, not even the engineers from the days of Digital Equipment Corporation.</p>

      <p>We have come to understand the invaluable and non-quantifiable nature of the tribal knowledge that exists distributed among the great engineers of our industry, and we believe that we must act quickly to enable them to pass on the torch, to strengthen the next link of the great chain of our relatively young but quickly maturing industry.</p>

      <p>With this understanding, we have created the Kernel Development Learning Pipeline, a program to bridge the gaps between academia and industry, between the novice and the legend, between the past and the future.</p>

      for a regulation on Standard-Essential Patents (SEPs) to address issues of legal
      uncertainty, the vulnerability of SMEs, and transaction costs. This regulation
      could bring some peace of mind, or it could make matters worse. While software
      patents are not enforced by courts in Europe, the European patent offices continue
      to grant software patents. And with the Unified Patent Court (UPC) possibly
      coming in 2023, European software developers are not safe from patent uncertainty.</p>"
    description: |-
      <p>In this presentation we will outline the European Commission's motivations, the input they're working from and the solutions they're considering. The Commission mentions FRAND licensing terms among the solutions, but, is it thinking of a type of FRAND licensing that truly doesn't discriminate against free software? We will discuss definitions for FRAND which could give real protections for free software and we will look into precedents which could be used as a basis for protecting the use, development and distribution of software against patents. Since the Commission's preparatory documents state "legal certainty" as one of the main objectives for this regulation, and knowing that software developers would like to be free from the current legal uncertainty around patents, we might be able to find a basis for agreement on a solution. If the EU institutions are serious about being fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory, and if they're serious about standards and interoperability, this could be our chance to get a regulation which ensures that patents never block free software from abiding by standards.</p>

      <p>This regulation will affect a large number of fields, including many fields where innovation is measured in how many patents were obtained this year.  Software risks being collateral damage in a bigger tug-o-war between industrial sectors.</p>

      <p>Moving to Kubernetes opens the door to a world of possibilities, but as the number of resources, clusters and namespaces grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage.</p>

      <p>We will show how at Adobe Experience Manager we continuously deliver changes to cluster resources and have implemented a way of doing feature flags and progressive rollouts with Kubernetes yaml definitions, across multiple clusters and regions using Jenkins, ArgoCD, and other open source projects.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Running a cloud service in multiple Kubernetes clusters across regions, forced us to have high levels of automation, tied with monitoring and alerting across the globe.  The typical release train model (dev-stage-production) had shortcomings that soon became evident. Adopting Progressive Delivery allows us to move faster, safer, and reduce the mean time to recovery in case there are any issues. Both canary deployments and feature flags are typically used to implement Progressive Delivery at both application and operational service levels.</p>

      <p>Teams collaborate with a DevOps philosophy and a "you build it, you run it" approach, with freedom, but also requiring tooling to help teams deliver value with the least interference as possible. We are continuously improving this tooling to make it as easy as possible to safely deploy changes.</p>

      <p>The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized file system for building the next generation of the internet. IPFS is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data. In this talk, we‚Äôll dive into how decentralised storage with IPFS works under the hood as it builds on top of many long-known, well established techniques and yet is more than just the sum of its parts.</p>

      <p>We‚Äôll cover basic working principles like content-addressing and content-routing, followed by the results of an extensive measurement campaign. Answering questions like: How does content-addressing work? Who stores my data if I upload something to IPFS? How do you retrieve content if you only know the hash of it? How fast is that process?</p>

      <p>Seccomp has supported a notify target for a little while now.
      This can be used to delegate system call handling to a userspace process.
      Using this, it's possible to intercept any syscall (even a non-existing one) and have it be handled by a potentially more privileged userspace process.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>In LXD, we like running very safe containers. For that we use user namespaces by default, combined with both AppArmor and Seccomp policies.
      The result are very very safe containers but because of all that security, a number of actions just aren't possible or return odd values.</p>

      <p>System call interception gives us a way out there as we can selectively intercept system calls such as mount, sysinfo, ebpf, ... then run them through policies and if found to be safe, run them again with elevated privileges.
      We have been progressively growing the list of system calls that can be handled in that way with our eventual goal to complete deprecate the use of privileged containers.</p>

      <p>In this presentation, we'll be covering the general concept behind system call interception through the seccomp notify mechanism, some of the things to be extremely careful about and show the ones we have implemented to this day.</p>

      <p>Control groups (or cgroups for short) are one of the most fundamental technologies underpinning our modern love of containerisation and resource control. Back in 2016, we released a complete overhaul of how cgroups work internally: cgroup v2, released with Linux 4.5. This brought many new and exciting possibilities to increase system stability and throughput, but with those possibilities have also come challenges of a type which we have largely not faced in Linux before.</p>

      <p>This talk will go into some of the challenges faced in overhauling Linux's resource isolation and control capabilities, and how we've gone about fixing them. This will include some of the most complex and counter-intuitive practical effects we've seen in production, with details of how our expectations and knowledge have developed over the last 5 years using this on over a million machines in production, with insights that are immediately applicable to anyone who runs Linux at scale.</p>

      cgroup v2 is changing the technical landscape for distributions and containerisation

      Then, we'll discuss how OpenPype and Kitsu can be used to cover the asset management aspect (files) and the project management aspect (tasks and deliveries).
      Finally, we'll talk about the compositing step with Natron.

      <p>Creating a CNI plugin is a simple, but mostly undocumented, task. If you add plugin chaining the complexity is lofted by a layer. We‚Äôll be getting you to where you can create your base plugin and add it to a chain, and inspect the links of that chain, the CNI result passed between each.
      With CNI chains each plugin depends on information created at the previous step in the chain. We‚Äôll be relying on tools such as cnitool, dummy CNI plugins to chain and custom json configs. We'll show the tools we use every day to create a multi-step CNI plugin in a NetworkAttachmentDefinition.
      We‚Äôll talk about how to use different capabilities, handle logging and writing a custom plugin in the chain. We‚Äôll revisit concepts from the CNI spec such as prevResult and go from zero to a working multi-chain CNI plugin. We'll talk about how we architect CNI plugins to make debugging easier, and how to deploy them in a testing and production environment.</p>

    raw_abstract: <p>With RCS forecasted to grow to 3.8 billion subscribers by 2026
      (a 300%+ growth from today's population of 1.2 billion, according to <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/operators-providers/rcs-business-messaging#:~:text=Forecast%20Summary,a%20growth%20of%20over%20200%25.">Juniper
      Research</a>), Instant Messaging (IM) in SIP is becoming increasingly more important.</p>
    raw_description: |-
      <p>SIP is more than voice and video, it is also Instant Messaging and Presence.  Even if traditional SIP services are more voice-focused, Instant Messaging (IM) has gained a lot of traction in the context of IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) and Unified Communications (UC).</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://opensips.org/">OpenSIPS</a> <a href="https://www.opensips.org/About/Version-3-3-0">latest 3.3 release</a> introduces several new modules which facilitate the implementation of messaging services in both IMS and UC contexts.  Tune in to this presentation for an in-depth view on the new MSRP stack in OpenSIPS, new MSRP-related modules and other exciting features, as well as a Call Center UC demo towards the end!</p>

      <p>Scientific articles built on executable notebooks are already common in the domain of scientific publication, where they are an effective tool that brings transparency and openness in research communication (FAIR). However, they‚Äôre not yet widely praised in the humanities.
      Luckily, in the digital humanities, Jupyter notebooks play an important role in data analysis and exploration. They provide a free, powerful and open source platform for analyzing text corpora and other datasets in many programming languages - Julia, Python and R; they flawlessly integrate the browsers and many JavaScript data visualization libraries.
      In general, digital humanists know very well how to make use of Jupyter notebooks to quickly create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
      That‚Äôs why we naturally decided to work on Jupyter notebooks when we started playing with the idea of funding a Journal for digital historians in conjunction with the publisher DeGruyter. Developed by the C¬≤DH (Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History and DeGruyter, the Journal of Digital History (https://journalofdigitalhistory.org) now publishes peer-reviewed, open access articles that are Jupyter notebooks in their essence.
      With a difference: we wanted authors to reflect on their use of algorithms and digital methods, so we asked them to write their articles as compositions of three layers: narrative, data and hermeneutics.
      In our presentation we will explore the ecosystem of tools and methods we have prepared together with the authors: GitHub, Docker, MyBinder, Zotero. We will present the process we follow with them from scratch notebooks to published multi-layered, reproducible scientific articles.</p>

      <p>The Open Hardware Group (https://www.openhwgroup.org/) is a large industry/academic consortium developing a family of fully open source, commercial grade RISC-V cores, branded as CORE-V. These are supported by a full software ecosystem.</p>

      <p>In this talk we will look at the challenges of developing a vendor specific software ecosystem, how this ecosystem relates to the official upstream projects, and particularly the technical challenges in developing, maintaining and upstreaming vendor specific software.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Although CORE-V is a completely standard RISC-V architecture, it supports a large number of custom ISA extensions, and it is the support of these extensions that creates most of the challenge.  Many of these extensions come from the PULP research group at ETH Z√ºrich, but some are pre-freeze versions of what will become standard RISC-V extensions.</p>

      <p>The upstream projects generally provide mechanisms to support vendor specific variants, for example by use of the vendor field in the target triplet.  Thus rather than the generic riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc compiler, we can have the riscv32-corev-elf-gcc compiler. However this requires modifications to the code to use this information to control when CORE-V specific functionality is to be enabled, and this talk will explore these. In one specific case (vendor specific relocations), we are waiting on standardization from the RISC-V psabi committee, but otherwise this is all using well proven existing technology.</p>

      <p>The work has also served to expose gaps in the upstream projects. For example, while versioning of ISA extensions is standardized, the code base for the GNU assembler lacks the infrastructure to handle this.  Similarly many ISA extensions require builtin (intrinsic) function support, but the upstream tools have only a handful of builtin functions, and the infrastructure for RISC-V builtins is very small.</p>

      <p>The talk cannot cover detail of every tool and operating system being developed, so will concentrate particularly on the CORE-V GCC tool chain.  However we will draw parallels with the work going on in CORE-V specific simulators and in CORE-V specific operating systems.</p>

      <p>For ten years i'm involved in Public transport digital services (especially traveler information, trip planner, Mobility as a Service at Hove and now i'm the SNCF open data platform coordinator). I'm an Open transport advocate working for SNCF Group and organising Open Transport meetups, mainly in France, being also part of initatives who works on commons like Fabrique des mobilit√©s or OpenStreetMap. As i was part of the team when we opened Navitia trip planner source code and decided to have an open based strategy step by step (transport open data / open source / open API and SDK), i had the chance to be at the center of this great adventure at Hove, connecting with Navitia reusers an contributors, developing links with Open transport community.
      As open transport also means open innovation, it's important to work on developer's experience to facilitate either the integration of Navitia (open source) or the development of innovative services with Navitia Playgroung (Navitia API console).
      I propose to have a look in the rear view mirror, either the successes, showing concrete use cases from different sectors (mobility, tourism, real estate, employment), Navitia's reusers and contributers,... or some difficulties (long is the road), what are the next steps in the transport industry, with the European Union.</p>

    raw_abstract: |-
      <p>For ten years i'm involved in Public transport digital services (especially traveler information, trip planner, Mobility as a Service at Hove and now i'm the SNCF open data platform coordinator). I'm an Open transport advocate working for SNCF Group and organising Open Transport meetups, mainly in France, being also part of initatives who works on commons like Fabrique des mobilit√©s or OpenStreetMap. As i was part of the team when we opened Navitia trip planner source code and decided to have an open based strategy step by step (transport open data / open source / open API and SDK), i had the chance to be at the center of this great adventure at Hove, connecting with Navitia reusers an contributors, developing links with Open transport community.
      As open transport also means open innovation, it's important to work on developer's experience to facilitate either the integration of Navitia (open source) or the development of innovative services with Navitia Playgroung (Navitia API console).
      I propose to have a look in the rear view mirror, either the successes, showing concrete use cases from different sectors (mobility, tourism, real estate, employment), Navitia's reusers and contributers,... or some difficulties (long is the road), what are the next steps in the transport industry, with the European Union.</p>

      <p>In the context of MPI (Message Passing Interface), our talk presents a long-standing collaboration between RWTH
      Aachen and TU Darmstadt to further extend the MPI correctness checker tool MUST with memory allocation checking
      capabilities in the context of MPI (communication) calls for C/C++ target programs. To that end, we developed the LLVM
      compiler plugin TypeART. Both tools are open source and available under the BSD 3-clause license, see https://itc.rwth-aachen.de/must/ and https://github.com/tudasc/TypeART.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>In general, MUST‚Äôs correctness checking includes errors that already manifest - segmentation faults or incorrect results
      - and many errors that are invisible to the developer or only manifest with certain HPC systems and MPI libraries. MUST
      works by intercepting MPI calls of a target application at runtime, allowing for bookkeeping of the current program state.
      Thus, MUST can cope with the complex MPI semantics of, e.g., (a) collectives, (b) wildcards, or (c) datatypes.</p>

      <p>As a consequence of relying on intercepting MPI calls, though, MUST is unaware of the effective type of the allocated void*
      buffers used for the low-level MPI API. To that end, TypeART was developed to track memory (de-) allocation relevant to
      MPI communication. TypeART instruments heap, stack and global variable allocations with a callback to our runtime.
      The callback consists of (a) the memory address, (b) the type-layout information of the allocation (built-ins, user-defined
      structs etc.) and (c) number of elements. Thus, with TypeART, MUST can check for type compatibility between the type-
      less MPI communication buffer and the declared MPI datatype. Our tools also handle derived datatypes with complex underlying C/C++ data structures.</p>

      <p>WebRTC was obviously popular with developers during the peaks of the pandemic, but how is it doing now? Did all those new projects die, putting the community back at pre-pandemic ‚Äúnormal‚Äù levels or is WebRTC still going strong? Are there many new WebRTC-related repos? Is WebRTC still attracting new users and what are they doing?  How are newer API‚Äôs like Insertable Streams, WHIP, and WebCodecs doing?</p>

      <p>In this talk, Chad Hart of webrtcHacks and Kranky Geek will answer these questions with a fresh analysis based on a review of over a million GitHub events since 2019.</p>

      <p>Real-time open source messaging systems are easy to design and code when small, servicing a few hundred users, and with limited media handling features. When an open source project becomes successful, however, the community of users often demand a level of scalability that the original design did not anticipate - and the entire project with its ever increasing codebase  (in both size and complexity)  can fail miserably during this transition.</p>

      <p>Rocket.Chat as an open source project has to cross the chasm not only once but twice in its history.   The first time we took the wisdom of the time and bolt-on a multi containerized instances approach to the monolith project.  The result is both surprising and somewhat functional - easily servicing 10s of thousands of users. Satisfying the demand at that time.</p>

      <p>Continued success of the project led us to the second transition into a world-scale (approaching hundreds of thousands of users)  rich messaging system.  This transition required a complete re-architecture of the monolith server - an engineering debt that we knew we had to pay before long.  The result, after two long years with a lead R&amp;D team,  is what can be described loosely as a ‚Äúmicro services‚Äù based scalable-by-function backend.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we will go into some technical details of these two transitions; and fill the community in on a few interesting back stories along the way.</p>

      <p>Larry Wall (of Perl fame) famously cited Laziness as one of the three great

      C is still the lingua franca of systems programming, but if you want to do C
      programming right one thing you can't afford is to be lazy. You have to do
      manual memory management, behavior is written in stone at compile time and
      the joke goes that every non-trivial project has it's own linked list
      implementation. There exists however a not so well-hidden superpower that allows
      you to program in C, get the performance where it counts, and still
      have plenty of time for chatter around the coffee machine.</p>

      <p>That superpower is the Lua programming language.</p>

      <p>This lightning talk will approach Lua from a C programmer's
      perspective: how Lua can help alleviate some pain points of C, illustrate some

      <p>Code instrumentation is the primary means for extracting fine-grained performance data from programs. However, special
      care has to be taken to with regard to overhead management, as a full instrumentation can increase the runtime by orders
      of magnitude. Careful selection of the instrumentation configuration (IC), typically via filter lists, is therefore crucial to retain
      the performance characteristics of the original application. In order to give the user better control of what is measured, we
      have developed CaPI, an open-source tool for the creation of low-overhead, user-defined ICs. CaPI relies on a statically
      constructed whole-program call-graph as its central data structure, enabling the user to select functions based on the
      context they are called in, in addition to function-level metrics. Currently, this call-graph is generated externally by tools
      running on the source level. This can be cumbersome, especially when targeting large-scale scientific software.
      To mitigate this issue, we are developing an approach that runs the analysis on the LLVM intermediate representation
      during link-time optimization. Running during link-time also allows us to embed the result into the binary, improving the
      workflow and usability of CaPI. In this talk we will discuss the advantages and shortcomings of link time generated call
      graphs compared to source level generated call graphs, and show how statically generated information can be augmented
      dynamically at runtime.</p>

    subtitle: A FPGA-based Fedora-capable computer that can rebuild its own bitstream

    abstract: |-
      <p>I will demonstrate FPGA-based 64-bit RISC-V computer, capable of booting and
      running the riscv64 port of Fedora. Using Free/Libre packages available as
      part of the Fedora repositories, this machine is capable of recompiling not
      only its own software (e.g., kernel, glibc, gcc), but also its own gateware
      (i.e., FPGA bitstream), completely from source code, all the way down to (but
      not including) the physical (FPGA) silicon.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Modern hardware development shares many similarities with software: design and
      specification in a programmatic hardware description source language (HDL),
      and compilation of said sources into either photolitographic masks etched into
      silicon for Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), or into
      configuration data (bitstream) for a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).</p>

      <p>Hardware vulnerabilities (accidental or intentional) can be inserted during any
      such lifecycle stages: as part of the design in HDL sources, during compilation
      where buggy or malicious toolchains generate malfunctioning designs from clean
      HDL sources, or during ASIC fabrication, where masks are altered to etch
      backdoors or Trojans directly into the silicon.</p>

      <p>Once fabricated, ASICs are difficult, expensive, and impractical to check for
      vulnerabilities, which can be as bad as a privilege escalation backdoor
      allowing for a total system compromise, even in the absence of any software
      exploits available to the attacker.</p>

      <p>Let's begin by mitigating against ASIC fabrication-time backdoor insertion by
      using soft-IP-core hardware blocks on FPGAs, which are fabricated in the
      absence of any knowledge of the final design details, and also consist of a
      regular grid of identical, generic configurable blocks -- making it easier to
      inspect for defects.</p>

      <p>Having settled on FPGAs for hardware designs requiring enhanced assurance, we
      can mitigate against HDL source and toolchain vulnerability insertion by
      insisting on openly available sources to both, and on the ability of the system
      to be self-hosting, i.e., to rebuild everything, from source, without relying
      on assistance from any external "black box" or proprietary components.</p>

      <p>I will demonstrate a Fedora capable RISC-V computer based on the Rocket CPU,
      using LiteX for the rest of its chipset, deployed on a Lattice ECP5 FPGA board,
      with the bitstream generated from sources by a fully Free/Libre toolchain
      consisting of Yosys, Trellis, and NextPnR. Most importantly, the computer will
      be capable of (slowly) rebuilding its own bitstream, by being capable of
      directly executing the Yosys/Trellis/NextPnR toolchain.</p>

      <p>I will demonstrate FPGA-based 64-bit RISC-V computer, capable of booting and
      running the riscv64 port of Fedora. Using Free/Libre packages available as
      part of the Fedora repositories, this machine is capable of recompiling not
      only its own software (e.g., kernel, glibc, gcc), but also its own gateware
      (i.e., FPGA bitstream), completely from source code, all the way down to (but
      not including) the physical (FPGA) silicon.</p>
    raw_description: |-
      <p>Modern hardware development shares many similarities with software: design and
      specification in a programmatic hardware description source language (HDL),
      and compilation of said sources into either photolitographic masks etched into
      silicon for Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), or into
      configuration data (bitstream) for a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).</p>

      <p>Hardware vulnerabilities (accidental or intentional) can be inserted during any
      such lifecycle stages: as part of the design in HDL sources, during compilation
      where buggy or malicious toolchains generate malfunctioning designs from clean
      HDL sources, or during ASIC fabrication, where masks are altered to etch
      backdoors or Trojans directly into the silicon.</p>

      <p>Once fabricated, ASICs are difficult, expensive, and impractical to check for
      vulnerabilities, which can be as bad as a privilege escalation backdoor
      allowing for a total system compromise, even in the absence of any software
      exploits available to the attacker.</p>

      <p>Let's begin by mitigating against ASIC fabrication-time backdoor insertion by
      using soft-IP-core hardware blocks on FPGAs, which are fabricated in the
      absence of any knowledge of the final design details, and also consist of a
      regular grid of identical, generic configurable blocks -- making it easier to
      inspect for defects.</p>

      <p>Having settled on FPGAs for hardware designs requiring enhanced assurance, we
      can mitigate against HDL source and toolchain vulnerability insertion by
      insisting on openly available sources to both, and on the ability of the system
      to be self-hosting, i.e., to rebuild everything, from source, without relying
      on assistance from any external "black box" or proprietary components.</p>

      <p>I will demonstrate a Fedora capable RISC-V computer based on the Rocket CPU,
      using LiteX for the rest of its chipset, deployed on a Lattice ECP5 FPGA board,
      with the bitstream generated from sources by a fully Free/Libre toolchain
      consisting of Yosys, Trellis, and NextPnR. Most importantly, the computer will
      be capable of (slowly) rebuilding its own bitstream, by being capable of
      directly executing the Yosys/Trellis/NextPnR toolchain.</p>

      <p>Libre-SOC aims to develop a design for a hybrid CPU-GPU-VPU core for a family of System-on-Chip products, from embedded applications, routers, cell phones and laptops, all the way to high performance computing, using proposed scalable vector extensions for the tried and true POWER instruction set. Being a fully documented and transparent design is a core value of the project, ensuring mainline kernel integration with no effort wasted on reversing-engineering proprietary designs covered by NDA (non-disclosure-agreements), while avoiding untrusted binary blobs. The products should ‚Äújust work‚Äù, at its maximum performance and feature set, with full involvement and support for the community.</p>

      <p>Last year, Libre-SOC labored to produce its first silicon, a test chip, and produced its first Linux-capable networked proof of concept on an FPGA (field programmable gate array) development board. Using a completely FLOSS toolchain, any developer can build and test this design on their own computer, run it in hardware in a supported FPGA development board, or even build a full ASIC chip layout.</p>

      <p>In this talk I‚Äôll present topics of the ongoing architecture design and formal testing, being written in a modern, developer-friendly, Python-based hardware description language.</p>

    raw_abstract: |-
      <p>Libre-SOC aims to develop a design for a hybrid CPU-GPU-VPU core for a family of System-on-Chip products, from embedded applications, routers, cell phones and laptops, all the way to high performance computing, using proposed scalable vector extensions for the tried and true POWER instruction set. Being a fully documented and transparent design is a core value of the project, ensuring mainline kernel integration with no effort wasted on reversing-engineering proprietary designs covered by NDA (non-disclosure-agreements), while avoiding untrusted binary blobs. The products should ‚Äújust work‚Äù, at its maximum performance and feature set, with full involvement and support for the community.</p>

      <p>Last year, Libre-SOC labored to produce its first silicon, a test chip, and produced its first Linux-capable networked proof of concept on an FPGA (field programmable gate array) development board. Using a completely FLOSS toolchain, any developer can build and test this design on their own computer, run it in hardware in a supported FPGA development board, or even build a full ASIC chip layout.</p>

      <p>In this talk I‚Äôll present topics of the ongoing architecture design and formal testing, being written in a modern, developer-friendly, Python-based hardware description language.</p>

      <p>In the last decades, producing a "real" silicon chip was an effort that required a large-ish team, a fair amount of money, and inside knowledge that only a small, selected group of individuals and companies had. That has changed: free and open source silicon is here, and it democratizes access to chip design for anyone. Free tools in all areas of chip design, from simulation to synthesis and physical design, have attracted renewed attention and are at a point where they are powerful enough to be used for actual chip tapeouts. The last barrier of entry for prospective chip designers fell with the announcement of the SkyWater PDK two years ago: real-world design rules, required to manufacture chips, are now freely available as well.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we'll look at the open source silicon ecosystem: which tools do we have available, how are they working together in a toolflow, and can all of that be combined to produce a working chip?</p>

      <p>Open source software has irrevocably changed the way software is developed. Open source silicon is set to do the same: inject new life into the traditionally closed chip development ecosystem, combining ideas from the open source software world with the accumulated wisdom of seasoned hardware engineers.</p>

      <p>The open source software label was coined at a strategy session held on February 3rd, 1998 in Palo Alto, California. That same month, the Open Source Initiative (OSI) was founded as a general educational and advocacy organization to raise awareness and adoption for the superiority of an open development process. One of the first tasks undertaken by OSI was to draft the Open Source Definition (OSD). To this day, the OSD is considered a gold standard of open-source licensing.</p>

      <p>In this session, we'll cover the rich and interconnected history of the Free Software and Open Source movements, and demonstrate how, against all odds, open source has come to "win" the world. But have we really won? Open source has always faced an extraordinary uphill battle: from misinformation and FUD (Fear Uncertainty and Doubt) constantly being spread by the most powerful corporations, to issues around sustainability and inclusion.</p>

      <p>We'll navigate this rich history of open source and dive right into its future, exploring the several challenges and opportunities ahead, including its key role on fostering collaboration and innovation in emerging areas such as ML/AI and cybersecurity. We'll share an interactive timeline during the presentation and throughout the year, inviting the audience and the community at-large to share their open source stories and dreams with each other.</p>

      OpenVPN and Tor, Nym defends against global passive adversaries that have a
      "God's eye" view of the entire network, like the NSA. Nym does this by mixing
      internet packets at nodes so they do not exit the mixnet in FIFO, as well as
      adding fake traffic. Like Tor, any application and use SOCKS proxies to bind
      to Nym. As Nym is built in Rust, it also allows WebSockets and other direct
      integration. We can demonstrate how the Nym mix network hides network-level

      Mix nodes are ran in a decentralized manner and keep track of their reputation
      using the NYM token. Currently, there are approximately 500 mix nodes, but new
      nodes and applications are welcome. Nym works well for asynchronous, message-based
      traffic like instant messaging and e-mail, while Tor works better for synchronous,
      circuit-based traffic like Web browsing. Both projects should be able to work

      using the NYM token. Currently, there are approximately 500 mix nodes, but new
      nodes and applications are welcome. Nym works well for asynchronous, message-based
      traffic like instant messaging and e-mail, while Tor works better for synchronous,
      circuit-based traffic like Web browsing. Both projects should be able to work
      together to provide full-privacy for users.</p>"

      <p>This talk explores my recent experience of developing an emulator in Java for two of our favourite Z80-based retro machines, the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and Sega Master System. At first glance, Java may not seem the obvious choice for emulator development: it lacks features such as unions, macros and definable primitive types (at least until recently!) that are leveraged for efficiency by emulators written in C/C++; integrating with native libraries beyond those in the standard platform can add development complexity and performance considerations; meanwhile, our program runs in a virtual machine whose JIT compiler and garbage collector have the potential to introduce latency into time-critical code.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, Java is cross-platform and includes sound, graphics, UI and concurrency APIs out of the box and its native platform integration and under-the-hood optimisations have been steadily maturing. We will explore what Java has to offer the emulator developer using ‚Äútraditional‚Äù Java language and standard OpenJDK features alone, and see when and how to address some of our concerns when it comes to low-level data operations and performance.</p>

      <p>In a world where data continues to grow at an overwhelming rate, knowing how to load and insert data into PostgreSQL as efficiently as possible is a key skill for any software or data engineer. Whether loading data from files, manually generating multi-valued INSERT or UPSERT statements, or using some of the more popular language SDKs, knowing which option is right for each situation can sometimes be difficult to figure out.</p>

      <p>This talk will review how to efficiently insert large amounts of data into PostgreSQL using freely available tools and well-crafted SQL. We'll demonstrate the usage of tools like COPY, how to batch data using multi-valued INSERT statements, functions to look for in language SDKs, and even demonstrate how to use array parameters to speed up multi-valued inserts.</p>

      <p>By the end of this session, you will know at least four ways to insert bulk data, the impact it will have on your PostgreSQL database, and options for improving your current application code to perform at its best!</p>

Just like everything else in the IT world, the role of the DBA has evolved massively in that time. Has it changed beyond recognition, or does today‚Äôs DBA still do fundamentally the same job?</p>

      <p>I don‚Äôt imagine most DBAs currently spend their time reorganising their datafiles to create contiguous blocks of free space that the database can make use of. And I‚Äôm fairly certain the world is a better place for it.</p>

      <p>My 21 year-old self could never have imagined managing a self-healing, automated, scalable database cluster on Kubernetes.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, the questions of data modelling, disk capacity, query performance, and user management are as relevant today as they were back then.</p>

      <p>Let‚Äôs take a light-hearted look at the changing role of the DBA over the past couple of decades, with some guesses about what the DBA of the future will be doing. Or will autonomous databases finally have put us all out of work?</p>

      <p>Testing applications intended to run on high-performance computing clusters can be a painful process, especially when you do not have access to the resources you need. Sometimes you just want to check if you have the right compile flag specified, if the script you wrote actually works, or if your application can successfully use multiple cores. One way to test your HPC software is by <em>emulation</em>; instead of wasting precious compute time on your bare-metal cluster, you use a micro-HPC cluster that provides the same functionality as the bare-metal cluster on a smaller scale.</p>

      <p>This talk will discuss the concept and implementation of an open-source testing framework that builds upon micro-HPC clusters. We will explore how a micro-HPC cluster can be brought up using Python and deploy core software such as identity management, shared file systems, and environment modules. We will also be exploring the transferability of the testing framework, such as how we can ensure that tests can both be run in CI pipelines and on local development machines, or how can use pre-existing frameworks such as pytest or unittest to run the tests. Lastly, we will discuss limitations of the testing framework and future work that can be done to improve its capabilities.</p>

      Sometimes this requires self-service creation of RDMA enabled Kubernetes clusters.
      OpenStack can use SR-IOV using VF-LAG to provide RoCE RDMA within VMs.
      We make use of K8s Cluster API to provision K8s using OpenStack servers.
      We then use multus and macvlan CNIs to give k8s pods RDMA networking.
      Testing the performance is automated using a Volcano based K8s operator.
      We are working on also bringing this power to OpenStack Magnum.</p>

      <p>There are a wide variety of HPC systems across the world, and nearly as many ways of interacting with them using job submission systems. Therefore, migrating complex HPC workflows from a system to another may prove challenging. We present Troika, a tool that aims to abstract the details of the job submission system from the user, providing a single entry point for submitting, monitoring, and interrupting jobs on multiple HPC systems. Troika allows for a site-agnostic job script with directives, that can be translated to a script that the job submission system understands, based on configuration.</p>

      <p>Troika has been designed with extensibility in mind, to enable support for as many job submission systems as possible, as well as differences in the use of such systems. Troika is free software written in Python, exposing multiple entry points for hooks and plug-ins. It is a fundamental part of ECMWF's 24/7 time-critical operational and research workflows, making the glue between the batch scheduler and the workflow manager, where it handles hundreds of thousands of jobs each day. We will present how Troika works, as well as giving insights into its current and future applications.</p>

      <p>There have been multiple attempts in the past to create a modular distribution, where components (like the Python interpreter) can be swapped out for different versions. Such a distribution could solve the too-fast-too-slow problem of Enterprise Linux Distributions: the base operating system stays mostly frozen, and the packages go quickly out of date. The too-fast-too-slow problem poses bigger and bigger challenges in the modern and fast-moving development landscape: the stable base is not viable for building a modern application relying on the latest features. Therefore, a modular distribution would be highly desirable for enterprises to have a supported and stable base operating system with a modern software stack on top.</p>

      <p>Previous attempts at creating a modular distribution faced serious challenges: from overly complicated maintenance and inter-module dependencies to lack of acceptance in the community. But what is the underlying issue? Why has there not been a good solution to this problem yet? Can we solve everything with containers?</p>

      <p>This is a double talk about "What's in the new release of FFmpeg 6.0", and a "demonstration of VLC running inside Webbrowsers using Wasm".</p>

      <p>As FFmpeg 6.0 is approaching, what's new in it, what are the major and minor changes, and why you should care about the future work on FFmpeg.</p>

      <p>After that, a demonstration of VLC and its dependencies compiled to the web-browser using wasm, and using Webcodecs to decode the video.</p>

      <p>In high performance computing, package managers like Nix, Guix, Gentoo Prefix, and Spack are used to install applications and their dependencies. They allow multiple variants and flavors of the same package to coexist, by installing every package into a unique prefix directory that embeds a hash derived from the dependency graph.</p>

      <p>This non-standard directory structure can result in increased startup time of executables, as the dynamic linker has to search through many directories to locate all required libraries. This is especially problematic in the context of HPC and shared filesystems, since many instances of the same executable may start in parallel, causing a "stat storm" on the typically slow filesystem.</p>

      <p>This talk explores benefits and drawbacks of different solutions, and shows in particular how the Spack package manager solves this problem.</p>

      We first define common graph workloads and the pitfalls of benchmarking systems
      that support them, then explain our guiding principles that allow for conducting
      meaningful benchmarks. We outline our open-source ecosystem that consists of
      a scalable graph generator (capable of producing property graphs with 100B+

    description: |
      <p>Data processing pipelines frequently involve graph computations: running complex path queries in graph databases, evaluating metrics for network science, training graph neural networks for classification, and so on. While graph technology has received significant attention in academia and industry, the performance of graph processing systems is often lacklustre, which hinders their adoption for large-scale problems.</p>

      <p>The Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC) was founded in 2012 by vendors and academic researchers with the aim of making graph processing performance measurable and comparable. To this end, LDBC provides open-source benchmark suites with openly available data sets starting at 1 GB and scaling up to 30 TB. Additionally, it allows vendors to submit their benchmark implementations to LDBC-certified auditors who ensure that the benchmark executions are reproducible and comply with the specification.</p>

      <p>In this talk, we describe three LDBC benchmarks: (1) the Graphalytics benchmark for offline graph analytics, (2) the Social Network Benchmark's Interactive workload for transactional graph database systems, and (3) the Business Intelligence workload for analytical graph data systems. For each benchmark, we explain how it ensures meaningful and interpretable results. Then, we summarize the main features of the benchmark drivers and list the current reference implementations (maintained by vendors and community members). Finally, we highlight recent audited benchmark results.</p>

      <p>The Spack package manager is widely used by HPC sites, users, and developers to install HPC software, and the Spack project began offering a public binary cache in June of 2022.  The cache includes builds for x86_64, Power, and aarch64, as well as for AMD and NVIDIA GPUs and Intel's oneapi compiler.  Currently, the system handles nearly 40,000 builds per week to maintain a core set of Spack packages.</p>

      <p>Keeping this many different stacks working continuously has been a challenge, and this talk will dive into the build infrastructure we use to make it happen.  Spack is hosted on GitHub, but the CI system is orchestrated by GitLab CI in the cloud. Builds are automated and triggered by pull requests, with runners both in the cloud and on bare metal.  We will talk about the architecture of the CI system, from the user-facing stack descriptions in YAML to backend services like Kubernetes, Karpenter, S3, CloudFront, and the challenges of tuning runners to give good build performance.  We'll also talk about how we've implemented security in a completely PR-driven CI system, and the difficulty of serving all the relevant HPC platforms when most commits are from untrusted contributors.  Finally, we'll talk about some of the architectural decisions in Spack itself that had to change to better support CI.</p>

      <p>Software has been a common thread across all of  NASA's major achievements from the Moon landing to the deepest images of our Universe. Today, NASA relies on, releases, and contributes to Open Source Software to advance its scientific missions.  From powering our databases monitoring our planet and Sun to running in our missions on other planets, Open Source Software is critical to addressing NASA's biggest challenges on climate change, exploring the solar system, and discovering life beyond Earth. The Ingenuity helicopter, exploring the surface of Mars, is guided by Open Source Software. The amazing images of the earliest galaxies from the James Webb Space Telescope were made possible by open source software developed openly and contributed back to the community.</p>

      <p>Now, NASA is taking the next steps to further broaden the impact of open source by applying it to the scientific process with its Open Source Science Initiative. NASA is directly supporting open source scientific software through grants and contributions. To further advance scientific reproducibility and reuse, the scientific software underlying future scientific results will be made openly available and unrestricted mission software will be developed openly to allow for community contributions.</p>

When is the last time you migrated a legacy database and wondered what to use as replacement for VARCHAR2 or CHAR(255)? How to store IP addresses or geographical data, does that fit into VARCHAR or is there something more suitable?</p>

      <p>PostgreSQL 15 comes with around 40 different data types preinstalled. This talk looks beyond INTEGER and VARCHAR and dives into some of the lesser known PostgreSQL data types. Use cases and examples show which data type is a good fit for a certain situation.</p>

      <p>This talk will introduce one of the latest Fedora Remixes, the Asahi Fedora Remix! Asahi Fedora Remix exists to assist the Asahi community with Apple Silicon upstreaming and to provide a nifty ARM-based Fedora Workstation for those that own Apple Silicon hardware. We will discuss packages we have forked: kernel, kernel-edge, mesa. Some of the new characteristics of this distro include, 16k page size, a kernel built with rust drivers and hence a kernel built with clang/LLVM. We will show some performance results against some other x86 and aarch64 machines.</p>

      <p>On the community side, we will discuss some core values we try our best to abide by, such as our "upstream everything" attitude.</p>

      <p>This talk will introduce one of the latest Fedora Remixes, the Asahi Fedora Remix! Asahi Fedora Remix exists to assist the Asahi community with Apple Silicon upstreaming and to provide a nifty ARM-based Fedora Workstation for those that own Apple Silicon hardware. We will discuss packages we have forked: kernel, kernel-edge, mesa. Some of the new characteristics of this distro include, 16k page size, a kernel built with rust drivers and hence a kernel built with clang/LLVM. We will show some performance results against some other x86 and aarch64 machines.</p>

      <p>On the community side, we will discuss some core values we try our best to abide by, such as our "upstream everything" attitude.</p>

    abstract: "<p>Spack is a software distribution targeted at HPC systems, with over
      6,800 packages.  While Spack has long been a source-only distribution, in June
      2022 we added public build caches that offer fixed and rolling binary releases.
      With 400-500 pull requests per month, most of them package updates, this was
      a non-trivial task. The build cache model for Spack is similar to Nix and  Guix
      ‚Äî it assumes no ABI compatibility. Any change to dependencies triggers rebuilds
      of dependents. Despite these challenges we have been able to build a CI system
      that builds and tests packages on pull request and on release branches for a
      subset of several thousand builds for x86_64, Power, and aarch64, as well as
      for AMD and NVIDIA GPUs and Intel's oneapi compiler.  This talk will cover some
      of the main challenges we have faced: reliable build infrastructure, integration
      with pull request workflows, Kubernetes auto-scaling and AWS instance selection,

    description: |-
      <p>This talk is targeted at distribution maintainers, particularly people managing build farms for large distributions.  The goal of the presentation is to highlight the challenges of managing a rolling release for continuously evolving distributions hosted on GitHub.</p>

      <p>Spack manages 400-500 pull requests/month and is a very active repository.  Keeping all the builds working all the time, particularly in a build-from-source system where the recipes are templated, is a big challenge.  We may have the same package built many different ways in Spack (e.g. for different CPUs, GPUs, or MPI implementations), and all of those are managed by the same recipe and a very smart dependency/package configuration resolver.</p>

      <p>The talk will cover how we‚Äôve scaled build caching to manage PRs as well as release branches, and how we‚Äôve set up infrastructure that allows us to request builders with specific processor microarchitectures.  The CI system is orchestrated by a high availability GitLab CI instance in the cloud. Builds are automated and triggered by pull requests, with runners both in the cloud and on bare metal.  We will talk about the architecture of the CI system, from the user-facing stack descriptions in YAML to backend services like Kubernetes, Karpenter, S3, CloudFront, and the challenges of tuning runners to give good build performance.</p>

      <p>We'll also cover a bit about security in a completely PR-driven CI system.  Specifically, we cover how we guarantee that arbitrary public CI users can‚Äôt inject malicious code into our binaries.</p>

      <p>Choosing commits to build from the distribution tree has been a challenge as well, and in a build-cached system, choosing the right commit to <em>merge</em> a PR with can be a key factor in minimizing the number of builds that need to be done.  Specifically, we are trying to maximize <em>reuse</em> of builds done on the rolling release branch while still allowing PRs to update frequently.  Orchestrating this in CI, particularly when most systems want to merge with the head of the mainline, can be a challenge.</p>

      <p>Finally, we'll talk about some of the architectural decisions in Spack itself that had to change to better support CI ‚Äî specifically with the dependency resolver and how we choose exactly which stack configurations to build in CI for the rolling release.</p>

      <p>All of this topics should help distribution managers better orchestrate build farms, and they should be particularly relevant to other distributions that are similar to Spack, like Nix and Guix.</p>

      <p>We love minimalistic systems, because their concise models fit our brains, and give us a sense of understanding of the whole in a way that is nearly impossible in other environments built around huge frameworks and the like. Lua is a minimalistic language ‚Äî the source distribution of the language is about 360 kbytes.</p>

      <p>However, in any minimalistic system or language, that nice base system itself is just the tip of the iceberg. Minimalistic environments are meant to be extended. How to avoid complexity from creeping in?</p>

      <p>This talk will discuss the trials and tribulations of building LuaRocks, the package manager for a minimalistic language, aiming to nurture an ecosystem for the language while trying to keep its design true to the language's principles. We'll discuss lessons learned in the past 15 years of LuaRocks, and finally ask ourselves a question: is there such a thing as minimalistic software maintenance? What would that look like?</p>

      Started as a proof of concept about how to  build pkg plugin, pkg-plugin is now five years old and gain hundred of users around the world.

    abstract: "<p>In this talk, we describe the LDBC Social Network Benchmark's two
      workloads: the Interactive workload for transactional graph database systems
      and the Business Intelligence workload for analytical graph data systems.</p>"
    description: |
      <p>The Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC) was founded in 2012 by vendors and academic researchers with the aim of making graph processing performance measurable and comparable. To this end, LDBC provides open-source benchmark suites with openly available data sets starting at 1 GB and scaling up to 30 TB. Additionally, it allows vendors to submit their benchmark implementations to LDBC-certified auditors who ensure that the benchmark executions are reproducible and comply with the specification.</p>

      <p>We describe the key features of both workloads, including their data sets, queries, and update operations. We explain how they ensure meaningful and interpretable results via careful parameter tuning. Finally, we showcase the workloads' reference implementations (maintained by vendors and community members).</p>

      <p>Information on the talk:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Expected prior knowledge: specialized prior knowledge is not needed</li>
      <li>Intended audience: developers and users of graph database management systems</li>

      <ul>
      <li>G√°bor Sz√°rnyas is a post-doctoral researcher at CWI Amsterdam. He is the lead developer of the LDBC Social Network Benchmark's BI workload and the maintainer of the Graphalytics benchmark. He is a member of the LDBC steering committee.</li>

    abstract: "<p>Live channels are often carried as transport stream over UDP or
      RTP multicast. Often such a stream must be handed over to a 3rd party for further
      processing or distribution, via a dedicated L2 Ethernet link. In practice, to
      ensure network isolation, this requires copying the multicast stream between
      two VLANs (with optional processing), an operation performed by expensive and
      proprietary hardware equipments such as DCMs. This presentation will explore
      the options using standard PCs and OSS such as DVBlast. For even better isolation,
      the speaker will also explore software virtualization using Linux/KVM and the
      SR-IOV feature of some network cards. The use of these technologies with multicast
      has proven difficult, as this case study will show.</p>"

      In 2016, I founded Enlambda consulting. It helped many clients like Snabb and IOHK adopt Nix and enabled them to solve complex software distribution problems in our industry.
      In 2018, I launched Cachix to accelerate Nix adoption by focusing on infrastructure and education.</p>

      <li><p>Why QA is important 2. Fedora QA can contribute in many ways - (Ways to contribute as Fedora QA - Release Validation Testing, Bodhi Testing, Create Test Cases) 3. Oh! it's Buggy, time to raise it - (All about Triage and managing bugs in Bugzilla) 4. Come, join the party @ test day - (Introduction to Test Days) 5. Play with tools - (Testing tools like Beaker, Bugzilla) 6. Need some help? - (IRC channels, mailing lists, useful links)</p></li>
      <li><p>I would like to talk about why we have less women contributors in open source and how women can join open source community easily,
      how they can start doing small things to contribute.
      Also, how a community can provide more support for a women contributor to beat this ratio margin of men and women.</p></li>

      <p>For more than 14 years now, Jonathan is programming in Python. He likes discovering different programming paradigms and new languages. Right now, he is working for Cisco, where he has given Python courses to teams across Europe, he has been coaching other programmers, and develops some challenging internal tools.</p>

      <p>In the past few years, he has been focusing a lot on use cases that require a large amount of concurrency, including implementations of (multiplexing) networking protocols. He got familiar with structured concurrency in Python (trio/anyio/asyncio) and recently Tokio in Rust.</p>

      <p>In his free time, he created several popular open source projects that can be found on his GitHub page. Among them, prompt_toolkit, which has several thousands of users and over 140 contributors.

As this encounter had a lasting effect, I have been involved with FLOSS ecosystems, technologies and communities both from technical, philosophical and political perspectives more than thirty years later. I'm a board member of one of the largest German Linux User Groups (the LUG in Frankfurt, FraLUG) and a regular speaker at German and international FLOSS events. Together with Martin Visser I host one of the fastest-growing FLOSS podcasts named Linux Inlaws. In my spare time, I am an Arch package maintainer and Python hacker.</p>

      behind the open-source vector search engine Weaviate - Etienne worked as a Freelance
      Software Engineer with a focus on building, fast, reliable, and scaling software.
      As part of this journey, he temporarily joined new and established software
      teams as a full stack engineer or tech lead to help them build better applications
      faster. Through various projects, ranging from European startups, SMEs, and
      large-scale enterprise companies, Etienne managed to get to know a wide array
      of technologies covering the full stack from backend to frontend to DevOps,
      as well as meeting, working with, and leading engineers and stakeholders. Industries
      covered include retail, wholesale, e-commerce, finance, broadcasting, and software.
      The one thing that tied all projects together is the following mindset: Get
      applications to production fast, and make sure once in production applications
      are fast, reliable, observable, and scalable.</p>"

    abstract: "<p>I have been a GNU/Linux enthusiast since my early college days with
      keen interests in networking, cloud computing, self-hosting and operating systems.
      Having been diagnosed with an acute distro-hopping syndrome, I have tried a
      multitude of GNU/Linux distributions before settling for Fedora Workstation
      (and never moving away since). The use of leading-edge technologies, distribution
      as quick point releases and the support by a friendly diverse collective of
      users and contributors made me want to give back in a way that helps the community
      grow substantially. Being a proponent of free and open-source software, I advocate
      for equitable and inclusive participation in the projects that I help develop
      and maintain.</p>"

      services on Fedora Infrastructure and CentOS Infrastructure. I have also been
      leading the efforts on revamping the workflow of managing our websites and application
      as being the lead of the Fedora Websites and Apps Team and an objective representative
      in the Fedora Council. To help with the mentorship efforts, I have also been

      <p>Hi, I'm Didier, a technology and computer security enthusiast. I started my career as a computer security ninja, defending informtion systems from cyber threats using my Jedi skills. However, I also have another side to my personality that comes out at night, that of a benevolent hacker. I like to use my skills to support the values of open source and I strongly believe in it.</p>

      <p>I believe that technologies can be used to improve people's lives, but this can only happen if we work together and share our knowledge. That's why I'm also a strong advocate of collaboration and openness in the technology industry.</p>

      <p>At the end of the day, I'm proud of what I do and I hope I can continue to help people through my work. May the source code be with you !</p>

    description: |-
      <p>I have a solid background in my field of work (technical software), adequate knowledge of neighboring domains (mathematics, electronics, physics, chemistry, biology, etc.), and an active interest in everything else that turns out to be relevant. I like working with professionals from both software and other domains. I have worked in industrial, space, military and academic domains in various roles where electronics, reliability, resource constraints, real-time aspects, and data-communication were important.</p>

      <p>I started my career as programmer with one year as a one-man development team for a hospital laboratory. Next I joined the hiring company ICT Automatisering, for which I worked internally and externally at various projects. I became a 'problem solver' for technically challenging problems that involved both software, and other technical domains. For me 'solving' means identifying and (as far as possible) quantifying the consequences of the available alternatives, so a well-founded decision can be made. Often the non-software aspects (hardware, costs, risks, schedule impact, politics, company culture) are what makes a problem really interesting (and challenging).</p>

      <p>In 2001 I started as an independent, with a webshop and hiring myself out as a freelancer. The shop expanded, and the freelancing was replaced by fixed-price contract work, and a small assignment as lecturer. My main activities involved Microchip PIC and ARM/Cortex micro-controllers. I still sell these chips (and related components), and some products that contain these chips.</p>

      <p>From 2010 onwards my work gradually shifted from the webshop ad freelancing to lecturing. As a lecturer, I really enjoy passing my knowledge and experience on to new generations of embedded software engineers, both technical aspects and the enthusiasm for the field. I prefer to combine different formats: written material, lectures (life and recorded), interactive work sessions, small-group discussions, home assignments, individual and group projects. I activate the internal motivation of students (and colleagues) by providing individual challenges and bringing them into contact with professionals in the field.</p>

      <p>I am a firm proponent of using C++ for small embedded (micro-controller) systems. I have held talks at various C++ conferences on this subject, and I participate in the SG14 GameDev &amp; low latency ISO C++ working group, which is part of the ongoing C++ standardization and evolution process.</p>

      <p>Hey,
      My name is Yaniv Ben Hemo.
      Living in Israel, married to Nicole, father of Ari and Balu - our beloved Golden Retriever.
      I started to code when I was ten years old, triggered by an old HTML book given by an old neighbor (He was not a wizard).
      That was when I understood my life‚Äôs passion or at least the category.
      I have been doing my best to learn, evolve, and code ever since.
      For the past years, I have been fascinated by data and the power it holds within it, which made me deepen my career in data engineering.
      On January 5th, 2022, alongside my three best friends from college, we founded Memphis, a real-time data processing platform out of our struggles as devs working with technologies such as Apache Kafka, and streaming pipelines. yaniv@memphis.dev</p>

During the night he is busy improving OSv, an open-source versatile modular unikernel designed to run a single unmodified Linux application securely on top of a hypervisor. He has been contributing to the project since 2016, when he first got exposed to and fascinated by OSv. Four years ago he was nominated as one of its committers. In that time, he has contributed over 500 patches, which most notably involved enhancing OSv to run on AWS firecracker (http://blog.osv.io/blog/2019/04/19/making-OSv-run-on-firecraker/) and improving ARM port.
      Finally, he gave a presentation about OSv at the P99 conference in 2021 (https://www.p99conf.io/session/osv-unikernel-optimizing-guest-os-to-run-stateless-and-serverless-apps-in-the-cloud/).</p>

      <p>‚ÄúEducation doesn‚Äôt need to be reformed it needs to be transformed‚Äù - Ken Robinson</p>

      <p>A quote yoshi first heard during his internship abroad at Elewa, a company striving to offer quality education at all schools in Kenya even those from less fortunate areas. Working in collaboration with schools in Kenya was truly an eye-opening experience for him. Technology can be used to improve education for everyone everywhere, and better education gives everyone a more equal chance for a better future.</p>

      <p>This is the thought driving yoshi during his research as a PhD student in the field of technology-enhanced learning at the WISE lab under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Beat Signer and as a volunteer at HackYourFuture Belgium. In his research he is mostly focused on the creation of personalised learning environments used to teach computing education based on knowledge graphs, ontologies and adaptive systems.</p>

      Actually he is the maintainer of BonSlack distribution, a Slackware porting to various CPUs/systems (ARM, Alpha, HPPA, LoongArch64, MIPS, OpenRISC, PowerPC, RISC-V, S/390x, SH4, SPARC64), and he is a translator volunteer for the FSFE community.</p>

      <p>"With industry experience into education" - this plan worked out. Since 2014, Tasso Mulzer has been a laboratory engineer at Department VII in Berlin University of Applied Science, after working as a development engineer at EBK Kr√ºger GmbH (now EBK Group). "I had some exciting projects whose technology ended up in forklifts or the Porsche 911." In the lab, he helps students "get over the hurdles of practice on the equipment." Technical development is also part of his job. After training as a communications electronics technician, he moved from Munich to Berlin. At the TFH, he graduated in 2010 with a degree in mechatronics, one of the last Diplom-Ingenieur (FH).</p>

      <p>In addition to his work, civic engagement is very important to Mulzer. Anything that involves education, digitization and technology captivates him. For 17 years, he was active with the German Federal Agency for Technical Relief (Technisches Hilfswerk) as a group leader in the infrastructure section and squad leader in the wide-area transport squad. But "number one is my family - they deserve it no other way!" says the married father of three proudly. In their free time, the five are sailing on the water from time to time.</p>

      Building and leading OSS teams and projects.
      Currently CTO of Sovereign Cloud Stack.</p>
    description: |-
      <p>Kurt Garloff has spent his professional life with Open Source projects. Educated as physicist (in Dortmund and Eindhoven), he has a desire to fundamentally understand things. Applying this to computers made chosing Open Source a natural consequence. In the end, the global collaboration with smart people and the contribution to democratizing a technology that's becoming more and more important became the most fascinating driver in contributing to open
      source. He developed from a Linux kernel developer to someone who loves working intensely with people that do such work. From time to time, he still loves touching code himself.</p>

      <p>Leading the growth of SUSE Labs, he had the opportunity to forge successful teams from brilliant individuals. He later complemented this with technical,
      strategic and business leadership functions in SUSE and received training at the Harvard Business School to hone the needed skills. Since 2011, his focus is
      on cloud technology and is an active particpant of the Open Infrastructure Community. As VP Engineering at Deutsche Telekom and later as chief architect
      of the Open Telekom Cloud, he has been involved with building quite some open source cloud infrastructure.</p>

      <p>Since early 2020, he is working with an increasing number of co-workers on defining and assembling a standardized, open, modular technology stack that
      enables a large number of operators to jointly provide large, federated, open cloud &amp; container infrastructure. This is the Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS)
      project of the Open Source Business Alliance. It participates actively in Gaia-X and has received a significant grant from the German ministry for economic affairs, has already released R2 of the reference implementation in March 2022. Three public cloud providers are in production with it currently, more are upcoming.</p>

    abstract: <p>Jason is currently a software engineer within the high-performance
      computing team at Canonical. He originally got into the HPC industry when he
      was in university and found that he really enjoyed tackling the challenges faced
      by end-users and system administrators of HPC clusters. His day job (what he
      does at Canonical) is largely focused on making Ubuntu a better platform for
      HPC ranging from deployment to just getting your software installed where you
      need it. This involves packaging a lot of popular open-source HPC applications
      for Ubuntu - for example, Apptainer - and developing "HPC operations as code"
      in the form of Juju charms. His night job (what he works on in his free time)
      is experimenting with "micro" HPC clusters. A common problem that he found in
      his work was that he had no effective or easy way to test the software that
      he was developing. Therefore, he started building out micro-HPC clusters using
      open-source container/virtual machine hypervisors (LXD, kvm, etc.), OpenLDAP,
      SLURM, and NFS. Now he is working on a testing framework that wraps around this
      micro-HPC concept called "cleantest". What he hopes to accomplish with this
      framework is to be able to effectively bring up the nodes of the cluster, inject
      Python scriptlets that perform the tests, and be run on any substrate whether
      it be your local machine to a Jenkins pipeline hosted somewhere in Arizona.</p>
